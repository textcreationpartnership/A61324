            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN EPISTLE From a Friend of the Author's, To the READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WIthout addition, for I am unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to miſcall thee, who art a ſtranger to me, and I know not thy due titles or Epithites, but be what thou wilt, but a <hi>Satyr,</hi> and I care not: I would not have the Fire fright thee, nor have thee burn thy fingers, but have thee to underſtand, that a due and
<pb facs="tcp:51297:3"/>per uſe of that which is a bad Maſter is to make it a good Servant, who when kept in diſcreet obedience, can be a thouſand waies profitable, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to thee. I here appear like a Prologue-ſpeaker to a Play of <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s, whoſe Apprentice I am, a kind of <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior Cyclops,</hi> and my Maſter bids me tell thee bluntly (without making a leg, or complementing thy favour,) that if thou wilt have patience he will ſhew thee ſport enough, and (if thou haſt wit) how not to repent of thy twelvepence here laid out for his ſake. For thus much I ſhall anticipate, Thou wilt find the lame leg cured, and <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> not onely able to walk, but run on both, and that ſo nimbly that he needs no golden balls to catch his <hi>Hippolita,</hi> or a Net for <hi>Venus,</hi> but quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the flying <hi>Daphne,</hi> and does then more than <hi>Apollo</hi> could, <hi>viz.</hi> ſatisfie his own deſires and thy wiſhes. This (Reader,) thou ſhalt be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taind within the Sequel, which thus I
<pb facs="tcp:51297:3"/>blow the Trumpet to, and hang out alſo a ſcurvy kind of picture of the ſtrange Water-Fire-works to be ſeen within, and without jugling, ſhew thee the Sea burning, and the Fiſh in a doubt, whether they are roaſted or boiled, yet when the Cookery is done it proves the wholeſomeſt diſh in the world, and if thou prove worthy to taſte, thou wilt confeſs it both food and Phyſick, pleaſant and profitable.</p>
            <p>If thou ask who firſt compleated theſe rarities, I anſwer, a Noble Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Artiſt, One (with reverence be it borrowed) that like another <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> rode here with horſes all of fire, and at length having paved his Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot with love, and guilded it with light, drove directly into eternity, leaving his mantle and a double portion of his ſpirit upon an <hi>Eliſha</hi> now travelling to and fro, and encompaſſing the earth to deſtroy the works of that deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that takes the ſame journey like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may
<pb facs="tcp:51297:4"/>devour. And to make up the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate, I may preſent to thee this our <hi>Authour,</hi> and ſo thou maiſt like <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> behold the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren walking in the fiery fornace, chooſing that, rather than to fall down and worſhip the Image which Prince <hi>Gallen</hi> hath ſet up, and commanded all that are his Subjects to adore and bend their knee to. And further (for the ſimile is thine, if not fourfooted,) there is a fourth amongſt them, who is like the Son of God, that true and Divine Wiſdom, and therefore the fire hath no power over them, but is their pleaſant garden, and freſh walks, wherein they gather the ſweeteſt flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, flowers of <hi>Sun,</hi> the fair <hi>Lunaria,</hi> apples of <hi>Paradice,</hi> Fruit from the tree of Life, and therefore are profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed enemies to death, and his armies of diſeaſes, the leaves of that tree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the healing of the Nations. And wonder not, <hi>Reader,</hi> that I allude to <hi>Eden</hi> the Garden of God, whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:51297:4"/>guardian Angel ſtands ſentinel with a naked flaming ſword, that no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns but he that paſſes thorow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht of that flaming blade, and he that hath paſſed thorough this fiery trial, hath freedom of acceſſe to the midſt of the Garden, where (thou knoweſt) God planted his <hi>Arborem Vitae:</hi> But without fire is no expiation, becauſe no ſacrifice, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no ſervice: Becauſe to him that overcomes is it onely given to eat of the hidden Manna.</p>
            <p>But by this, perhaps I and this book grow too hot for thee to hold any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and away thou throwſt it; But prethee <hi>Reader</hi> which is hotteſt, thy ignorant dark zeal, or that pleaſant and unfeigned divider between the precious and the vile? That (I ſay) which is a conſuming and devouring flame of Hell, or that which kindly heats and warmes with bleſſed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love? anſwer thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>But hold, I am now mounted, and
<pb facs="tcp:51297:5"/>it may be quite out of thy ſight, and ſeem to thee as little as nothing, and accordingly thou eſteemeſt me. Wel, I will tell thee though where I am, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in words that thou canſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, if thou knoweſt any thing of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> thou knoweſt the element of Fire is the higheſt. Holloo (Reader) there I am, and will make bold with thy Stagirite, and tell that Gentleman, he ſaith not true (not to give him the lye, leſt his Champions ſtab me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.) For this Fire burns, and can roaſt as many animals as his worſhip reckons up in his muſter-book of that ſubject, and may make a Feaſt able to dine his great Patron, if he had wine enough too for the royal <hi>Fudler.</hi> This will the Spheare of fire perform, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this any thing that the Culinary doth or can do. For to ſpeak plainly of theſe two in the words of <hi>Triſmegiſt,</hi> That which is above is as that which is beneath, and this is a truth moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tain, and all for the work of one and
<pb facs="tcp:51297:5"/>the ſame thing, ſo that if any difference be, it is the <hi>Culinary fire</hi> ſerves all the turns we uſe it for, in our houſes upon earth, and the <hi>Elementary</hi> doth the ſame for the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Heaven. Now therefore (<hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>) I adviſe thee to wipe thy eies, I am nearer to thee then thou thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And to remove thy prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I proteſt to thee, I am no Perſian Idolater; the fire is not my Diety, yet all is Oracle that it ſpeaks, there is no Amphibology and equivocation in its expreſſion, no, it is the ſincereſt Being in the World, it can abide no masks or coverings what ever, but pulls all off, gives thee the naked preſence of all, and woe to the hypocrite (who is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but cloaths) that falls into it. It is all gold that lies ſafe in its boſom, and happy art thou if by thy ſervices thou winneſt ſo much upon it, as to pertake of its boſome. It hath its match no where, but onely in the Water, Mrs. <hi>Aqua</hi> is its <hi>Eve,</hi> and he is a high Prieſt
<pb facs="tcp:51297:6"/>of Nature that can join their hands and hearts, that can reconcile that great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is between them, and make them embrace: their off-ſpring is ſtill wonderful, and named <hi>Wiſdom, Length of daies, durable riches, true and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial honour. Ignis-Aqua</hi> is a marriage from w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we may expect more of a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal peace then the Pope can from a Match of the Son of <hi>Spain</hi> to the Daughter of <hi>France.</hi> He with his two <hi>Indies</hi> joined with her nimble wit, ſprightful behaviour, and pleaſant and paradiſical ſituation, cannot boaſt of a compleater happineſſe and a more rich and perfect glory, then the uniting of theſe two with their Kingdoms and large Territories. For I tell the, <hi>He</hi> and <hi>She</hi> have the Empire of the whole World, and (without <hi>Hyperbole</hi>) the ſun riſeth and ſets within the limits of their juriſdiction. Iudge now (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) of his <hi>Purſe,</hi> that is favourite to theſe two; and of his <hi>Power,</hi> whom they will ſerve; of his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> whom
<pb facs="tcp:51297:6"/>they teach, of his <hi>unparalelled hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> that can call them his. But I do thee an injury to detain thee thus long: this is the painted Flag (as I told thee,) the living prodigy is within; enter therefore and behold all, and when thou haſt done, confeſs thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver didſt ſee the like: wonder then, &amp; commend his pains that hath travailed into ſtrange Countries to fetch theſe home to ſhew them to thee, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out envy to teach thee to do the like. I have a mind (Reader,) to put into thy Contemplations and leave thee: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then what a ſtrange nature is that thing of, which can never be fed too much, what a Symbole of infinitude lies in a ſmall ſpark. Here give thy thoughts liberty, and when thou reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt begin again to think whence coms this ſame thing called <hi>Fire,</hi> and whither goes it? what is it, and what doth it? when you have taken that turne, ſtep again forward thus, VVhy doth the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Chymist</hi> promiſe to Epilogue
<pb facs="tcp:51297:7"/>the world with <hi>Fire,</hi> why did he once waſh it with water, and will not now cleanſe it again but with fire? why are <hi>Fire</hi> &amp; <hi>Water</hi> the Parents of all beings viſible, bringing them forth, bringing them up, and yet at laſt turn <hi>Canibals,</hi> and eat their own Children? Theſe and 1000. the like thou mayeſt pry into without the charge of being curious. Attend therefore to thy Maſter, <hi>Audi Ignis vocem,</hi> and be not Childiſh in thy apprehenſions; not a dull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent Auditour at the Lectures read to thee <hi>in Schola Pyrotechnicâ,</hi> Hear this experienced Profeſſour, this Doctour illuminate, whoſe Text is, In the ſweat of thy browes, thou ſhalt eat thy bread, whereof the Poet makes this,
<q>Dii vendidere ſudoribus artes.</q> Liſten not to the cry of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, it is a Beaſt, and wilde, and therefore cannot endure the fire, nor
<pb facs="tcp:51297:7"/>to come near it; but call this VVorld a Deſart, a Forreſt of Lyons, Bears, Tigers, and (in this ſence) it hath but one part, its all an <hi>Africa,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy ſelfe in the midſt of this wood, ſee thy danger, and the open jawes of roaring beaſts, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and ſecure thy ſelfe with a wall of Fire, and then let them howle, they cannot rend nor tear thee, Be not therefore diſcouraged, if thou art thus engaged, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the VVorld hath no Coyne to pay off their debts to good men, but ſuch as bears the ſtamp of evill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and indeed how can that which is all evill it ſelfe, bring any good out of its Treaſury. Therefore ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that thy Preſent is evil, when it pleaſeth the evil world, but when it makes faces at thy Phyſick, and ſpits &amp; ſpues out thy pils as bitter, then eſteem thy Potion wholſome, although the world take it not, it is a child and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding.</p>

            <head>To the Honourable, Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and moſt accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Gentleman, <hi>ROBERT BOYL</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce it was my good fortune firſt by the occaſion of our mutual Friend, Dr. <hi>Robert Child,</hi> (whoſe memory being a man moſt learned and ingenuous, I honour,) to kiſs your Honours hand, your love to me hath ever continued ſo real and conſtant, that if I ſhould not take ſuch notice of it, as to my povver to acknovvledge it, I ſhould vvorthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the black note of infamy; but yet if I should aſſign this love of yours as the cauſe of this preſent Dedication, I ſhould be very injurious both to you and to the Truths. To you, ſince your deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings are ſo great, as to your ovvn perſonal accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments, that vvere you to me a meer ſtranger, yet your ovvn vvorth may above any other that I knovv in <hi>England</hi> challenge this Dedication, as one
<pb facs="tcp:51297:10"/>to vvhom the God of Nature hath been ſo ſignally propitious, as to diſcover many of Natures moſt ſecret operations, in their cauſes and vvork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings unkovvn to many learned men. To You I therefore preſent theſe my <hi>Pyrotechnical lucubrations</hi> as a mean Painter may preſent a draught to the Cenſure of <hi>Apelles,</hi> herein acknovvledging Your Worth, and alſo taking off the ſuſpition of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture from the things I vvrite, vvhich being throvvn humbly at the feet of ſo able a judge of their veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deſire Your acceptance onely according to their worth and reality. Take in good part then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat You theſe Lines, (not ſuch as I wiſh them,) but ſuch as the rudeneſs of my underſtanding could prompt me; aſſuring you, that though meanly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned in words, yet they contain ſuch real expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, which will be very acceptable both to You, and to as many as have delight in the ſearch after the myſteries of Nature, and am confident that theſe operations in future ages will praiſe their School, in which I have been a painful, though an unworthy Scholar.</p>
            <p>As for my ſelf I need not make any Apologie to your honour, as being known ſufficiently to You: and Your Candor and Ingenuity being very ready to excuſ for me what failings You may diſcover in me, Now that to ſuch a friend, I affect rather plainneſs and truth, then the garniſh of words, to You, I doubt not, but it will be the rather acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable; let others judge of my rudeneſs as they pleaſe. I would not be ſo bold as to prefixe this dedication before the firſt part of this Treatiſe, which is Apologetical, and ſomewhat tart, againſt the abuſes of the <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> becauſe I would not ingage your honour with me in any quarrel, that
<pb facs="tcp:51297:10"/>part therefore I leave to it ſelf to ſink or ſwim ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the weight or lightneſs of its Reaſons and Arguments; the Moving Cauſe to which ſmartneſs, was the uncivility of the <hi>Galenical</hi> party, in reproching and reviling this noble Art in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and <hi>Helmont</hi> in particular (to both Your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and My ſelf a deſerved favourite,) whom I formerly made My <hi>Chimical Evangeliſt,</hi> but do now believe, not convinced <hi>by</hi> his Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but by experimental Confirmation, and practical ocular demonſtration.</p>
            <p>My ſelf indeed, have from the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of the worthie Art and Artiſts of <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> and <hi>Pyrotechny.</hi> received many uncivil abuſes upon that very ſcore; on which grounds I may be thought to have written ſo ſharply in revenge: but although it is very true that <hi>Parit indignatio verſum,</hi> yet I can truly affirm, that it was not upon the ſcore of private grudge that I was invited to take up the buckler, but becauſe I ſaw truth it ſelf affronted, and contemned in the perſons of its moſt deſerving Champions, ſuch as were <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> Now fearing leſt if ſuch reproches ſhould paſſe without Animadverſion, the Common people who cannot read either <hi>Helmont</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> the exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickneſs of the language in which they wrote keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them lockt from moſt of our Engliſh Nation, yet whoſe lives are neerly concerned in what they treat of, for this Cauſe I put pen to paper, who otherwiſe had rather choſen to lie hid, and did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Apologie of thoſe, whoſe books other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I confeſs my ſelf unworthy to commend. Yet if God, who is only wiſe, have choſen the mean and fooliſh things of the world to confound the loftie and wiſe, I hope no man of underſtanding will
<pb facs="tcp:51297:11"/>contend with him, nor will any of diſcretion under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value a treaſure, becauſe in a poor earthen pot hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Theſe things I write not to Your honour, as fearing or ſuſpecting Yourſelf inclinable to ſuch a ſpirit of prejudice, but as ſenſible of mine own undeſervingneſs, I cannot but excuſe it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who perhaps know me little or not at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before hand ſatisfied, that Your honour would be more willing to cover my imperfections, then I (without impudence) could deſire, or with reaſon expect. And not to detain You longer in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, be pleaſed to view the Houſe it ſelf; to every Room whereof I ſhall account it my Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be your Guide, who before, and in all other things am, and muſt ſubſcribe my ſelf;</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble and worthie to be written in Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Gold is that ſaying of <hi>Cicero, Virtutis laus omnis in actione conſiſtit;</hi> To which agrees that of the Poet,
<q>Quo mihi fortunam ſi non conceſseris uti?</q> What profit is there of curious ſpeculations, which doe not lead to real experiments? to what end ſerves Theorie, if not applicable unto practice.</p>
               <p>And as this holds in all caſes, ſo more eſpecially is it true in <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> of which the whole would be vain and uſeles, unleſs the Theoremes of it were demonſtrable practically by the Fire.</p>
               <p>As therefore I have in my foregoing Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe Apologetically defended the Cauſe of <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical</hi> Medicine from the unjuſt reproaches of <hi>Galeniſts,</hi> and have proved that their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are really (that which they falſely charge upon <hi>Chemical</hi> Modicines) virulent and dangerous,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51297:12"/>and have moreover convinced them at large of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and inſufficiency, now it is time to bring on the Stage ſuch a Medicinal apparatus as may be, and appear both ſafe and effectual.</p>
               <p>The only whine of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> againſt <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> that ever I could hear, is and hath been, that he pulls down, but doth not build up, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to overthrow the uſed method of Medicine, but doth not introduce a better.</p>
               <p>How farre that Noble Philoſopher hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the diſcoverie of the true Medicinal Art, there is no Candid Son of Art, but muſt confeſs it, and hath cauſe to bleſs God for the ſame.</p>
               <p>But they who thus complain would be dealt with as infants are by Nurſes, have their meat not only prepared and provided, but alſo chewed and praemaſticated for them, which is a thing unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect; fooliſh to demand.</p>
               <p>My advice to ſuch is, that they would once cordially lay to heart, what a great charge lies upon them who have the care of lives, and what a great account will be taken of them at the laſt day, of which knowing the terrour, they may ceaſe from Covetouſneſs, Idleneſs, and ſelfconceited Pride; and acknowledging their ignorance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to attain true skill and knowledge, by thoſe waies and means which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>For our Books and Writings are onely as goads and pricks, and may ſerve for exhortations to all that are ſtudious and ſedulous, that every one for his own particular may endeavor to profit by his own labour and induſtrie, ſo far as the Almighty ſhall be pleaſed to aſſiſt him.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:51297:12"/>
               <p>Nor do we as in other Arts, write with intent that our writings may be underſtood promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by every Reader, and this is peculiar to this Art, and commanded in the Goſpel, that Pearles be not caſt before ſwine, and for this end we ſo write as not to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>To what end then do we trouble our ſelves and others, will ſome ſupercilious <hi>Galeniſt</hi> object, if not to be underſtood? and will urge his example, who meeting wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h a Book he could not underſtand, threw it away with this farewell, <hi>Quid mihi cum Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore qui non vult intelligi?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that practical and ſpeculative doctrines are far different, the one informs the judgement in the Reaſon of things, the other directs the hand in the mechanical practice.</p>
               <p>Now as to the ſpeculative part, our demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are moſt plain, true, and evident, as being drawn forth of, and grounded upon, the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the things we treat of; ſo that of the exiſtencie and efficacie of our Medicines, I know nothing that can be deſired, but what is fully and cleerly extant already in <hi>Helmont, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as touching the practical part, we are to be excuſed, if we ſo write, as onely to be underſtood by Sons of Art, and that not by bare reading, but by ſerious meditation, and unwearied praier to God, joined with indefatigable pains of ſearching in the <hi>Fire,</hi> which (under God) is the main Key to unlock all our Miſteries.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being attended; our Books then may ſerve profitably as Sea-marks, to thoſe who ſhall travail in theſe practices, that he may by pondering our Words, know if his operations

               <p>All other Agents are either ſingular, and ſerve each of them but in ſome Works, as Spirit of Wine, Vinegar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or univerſal, and ſerve for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal ſolution of all Bodies, as the liquour <hi>Alcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt,</hi> yet theſe are neither made nor uſed but by the means of the fire; therefore that is the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Agent in our work, though not of moſt virtue; of the largeſt uſe, though not of greateſt efficacie; for we have a liquor which will diſſolve and deſtroy, what it cannot, and what will abide fixt and conſtant therein, will in our liquor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, volatized, and ſeparated into its Elements; yet this is our hidden name, or <hi>Diploma</hi> not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable: but our outward Agent <hi>(the Fire)</hi> is viſible, and of moſt univerſal uſe, our Agent, <hi>ſinc quo non,</hi> by which we take our Denomination, and rejoice with <hi>Helmont,</hi> rather to be <hi>per Ignem Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi,</hi>) then to be created without it, by the Schools.</p>
               <p>The Art of <hi>Pyrotechny</hi> then (in brief,) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>So then ſince our Agents themſelves, owe their formal being to the preparation of the fire, this as the more univerſal agent gives name to our Art, which from the fire is Denominated <hi>Pyrotechny.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>FRom this that hath been ſaid, it may eaſily be gathered, that all who contend for a ſhare in this Art, are not to be accounted Heirs of the ſame; For it is not every one that can make a Fire, or a Furnace, that is to be accounted <hi>Philoſophus per Ignem,</hi> that is an <hi>Adeptus,</hi> but he only who knows how to work with the fire according to the true principles of Nature. Even as it is not every one that can furniſh himſelf with a good pen, a neat inkhorn, and fine paper may be adjudged a good Scribe; nor any who can procure to himſelf a good ſword, that is to be reckoned among expert Fencers, but they onely who can with skill and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51297:15"/>dexteritie uſe both the one and the other. Right ſo is it in this caſe, Convenient furnaces, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting veſſels are ſo neceſſarie to this work, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame, nothing can be done; yet many may provide themſelves of theſe external inſtruments, who yet in Philoſophie are as blind as moles, and as ſtupid as Aſſes.</p>
               <p>Nor yet is it every one that can make many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle operations in the Fire, that is an <hi>Adeptus;</hi> for the works of God are various and wonderful, and as any ſubject is handled diverſly, it will produce di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers effects, which though they may ſeem glorious to the eie, may yet be really trivial in value, which yet the inventors of them (through ignorance ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring their value at a high rate,) prate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, themſelves know not what, concerning them; to the diſrepute at laſt not only of themſelves, but of their Art.</p>
               <p>Therefore that true Art may not be cenſured for the ſake and cauſe of theſe pretenders, who are no Artiſts, but at the beſt, are Mimicks and Apes unto true Sons of Art, it will not be amiſs to decipher ſome of them, and paint them in their Colours, that ſo they may be known and eſteem'd for what they are, and not for what they are not, nor ever were.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ANd firſt, in this diſcoverie, I meet with ſuch, who having gotten into their hands ſome Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Treatiſe, forthwith have their minds on fire, till they ſet about the practical part, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to effect that which in their minds they have conceived.</p>
               <p>Theſe for the moſt part, chiefly level their aim, at the attainment of the Golden Fleece; for this they ſpend and are ſpent, they beleeve what they read, and imagine thereupon, and account nothing worth their inquiry, but the maſterie of <hi>Hermes,</hi> and think every thing unworthie their pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs it be the great <hi>Flixer,</hi> no fortune can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them unleſs they may happen to ſtumble upon that unhappy ſtone.</p>
               <p>This their deſign (unwilling to be ridiculous,) they will conceal to their power, pretending to the ſearch of ſome or other more than ordinarily noble Medicine, which they proſecute with that vigour that they may, when that is ended, cure all diſeaſes, hoping in that time to cure the maladies of their purſe, and then as for the care of the ſick they will leave that to others.</p>
               <p>Theſe Philoſophers at their firſt initiation have ſom one thing or other on which they dote, one on <hi>Rainwater,</hi> another on <hi>Maydow,</hi> a third on <hi>Sulphur vive,</hi> a ſourth on ☿, a fifth on ♁, a ſixth on <hi>Tartar,</hi> a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51297:16"/>ſeventh on <hi>Cold,</hi> an eigth on the <hi>Nitre of the earth,</hi> on which ſubject they imagine to themſelves ſtrange Chimaereal operations, of which as oft as they miſs, they are ſtill to begin again, and when they find not what they look for, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what they find as good as nothing. And thus they run from ſubject to ſubject, working ſubtilly but to no end, for becauſe that they hit not the mark propoſed, which perhaps, out of the ſubject they handle is but dotage to imagine, they never proceed to ſee &amp; ſeek what God and Nature hath put in the ſubject, but as ſoon as oft unſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trials have convinced them, that the <hi>Philoſophers ſtone</hi> is not there, they ſtraitway ſet themſelves to another ſearch.</p>
               <p>Theſe mens knowledge at beſt is but negative, they can tell you that there the <hi>Philoſophers Stone</hi> is not, but what is contained in thoſe ſubjects, that they know not, becauſe they never attempted to know.</p>
               <p>Of this kind of Philoſophers there are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort equally ſottiſh with the former, but far worſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe having ſpent their time and monies for a long ſeaſon in theſe unprofitable ſtudies, and at laſt having neither monie to ſubſiſt upon, nor an Art honeſtly to ſubſiſt by, they fall to meer Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, and commend that for all diſeaſes of men, which would never cure any diſeaſe in Metalls, Thus one takes the bones of men long buried, for his univerſal ſubject, and of them diſtills a faetid liquour, and ſublimes a volatile urinous Salt, ſuch as <hi>Harts-horn</hi> will give, and all bones, eſpecially thoſe which have lien rotting a long time; and this he commends for an univerſal medicine,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51297:16"/>and ſels at the price of Gold, attributing to it, out of a vain confidence, whatever the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have aſcribed to their Great <hi>Elixir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another for his ſubject takes foot of wood, which by the heat of the bath he promiſeth to decoct into the great <hi>Elixir,</hi> and preſuming on this as the true ſubject, he diſtills from it a Water impregnated with a volatile urinous ſalt, and a faetid Oile, which rectified tvvice or thrice, he calls it his <hi>Ignis Vitae,</hi> and commends it againſt all diſeaſes, and values it at half the rate of Gold.</p>
               <p>Theſe dotages are ſo groſs, that to name them is enough to confute them, and therefore I ſhall leave theſe dregs of Chemical Artiſts, fit to be noted with a black coal.</p>
               <p>Others there are, who having tryed the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of vulgar medicines, do flie unto mineral remedies, and Chemical preparations, and they at firſt, conceiving great pleaſure in the preparation of the ſame, and perhaps finding ſome greater ſucceſs in ſome of theſe then in ordinary Drugs, ſtraightway fall to writing of their diſcoveries that they may appear very learned, and will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile a large Volume of preparations, ſome perhaps only taken on truſt, many imagined only in phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, but never tried; This is a very great diſinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitie, and to thoſe who firſt give their Names to this Art, very prejudicial, eſpecially when they ſhall extoll dangerous poiſons for choice Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, ſuch as <hi>Turbith,</hi> and other preparations of ☿, and many preparations of ♁, which are not to be reck'ned among medicines, nor are they remedies fit for an honeſt man to uſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſort of men have brought into the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries ſhops a great ſort of Empyrical preparations,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51297:17"/>which for gains ſake, are daily more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated, inſomuch that <hi>Chemiſtry</hi> on this ſcore had almoſt been brought into diſgrace, had not ſome true ſons of Art, in every Age appeared, who might pluck off the vizard from theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſhew them to be indeed what they are, empty bubbles, making a great ſhow without any realitie, clouds without water, not vvorthie to be accounted vvhat they boaſt themſelves to be, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs then true Philoſophers.</p>

               <p>Secondly, vitious living, and wicked Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This will make all a mans endeavors unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nay rather, this hinders a man from an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſearch; for he who is once infected with vice, will never ſeriouſly, as he ought, apply his mind to ingenuitie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Idleneſs and Lazineſs, when a man would fain reap a plentiful harveſt, but will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the breaking up of his ground, and ſowing of his ſeed: This is the fault of many, who if they cannot attain a thing by reading, or by once attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they are diſcouraged and leav off.</p>
               <p>Fourthly I ride and Conceitedneſs, vvho think that all knovvledge is vvith them already, and if for a ſhort time they have laboured in this inquiry, they ſtraight preſume themſelves nothing inferior to <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus;</hi> of theſe, that of <hi>Seneca</hi> may be verified, <hi>Multi ad virtutem pervenire potuiſſent, niſi ſe putaſſ nt perveniſse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly Covetouſneſs, vvhen men are unvvilling to venture their monies in ſearch of knovvledge, and finding a pompous practiſe accompanyed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51297:18"/>vvith large gain, vvithout this expence and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they embrace the cheapeſt and eaſieſt vvay of gain and profit, accounting mony ſvveet, though gotten out of the ruines of Families, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſick, verefiing the Maxime of an unvvorthie Emperour, <hi>Dulcis odor lucri, ex re qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To all ſuch my advice is to keep from medling vvith theſe ſecrets, they are not for them, but prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſing thee, friendly Reader, rightly qualified, Pious, ſedulous, humble, and charitably endovved: I ſhall be thy guide, ſo far as one to another may communicate, vvithout tranſgreſſing the Rules of Philoſophie, vvhich is to exclude all unvvorthie perſons from this Art, to our povver.</p>

               <p>Some men can make their own furnaces, others order vvorkmen (every where to be had) to make them for them,) this makes an Artiſt neither bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nor worſe, for as a Fencer uſeth a ſword which a Cutler makes, ſo may it be in this caſe, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect about the form of Furnaces, ſo as to fit them to the Work intended, this is abſolutely required in a Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any thing that doth quicken inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, than a deſtitution of ſuch things as are to be deſired, in want of which oft times an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man, for a ſhift finds out ſuch compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Encheiria</hi>'s which he would never elſe have thought on.</p>

               <p>Medicines therefore vvhich are truly vvorthie to be ſo called, are of tvvo ſorts; either ſpecifick, or univerſal, that is, preeiſely applicable to ſome fevv diſeaſes, or univerſally povverful in all caſes.

               <p>THE Keies of this Science are <hi>Congelation,</hi> and <hi>Diſſolution, Volatization</hi> and <hi>Fixation,</hi> to theſe all <hi>Operations Chemical</hi> doe tend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Separation</hi> and <hi>Digeſtion, Fermentation,</hi> and <hi>Cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are all intended for this end, to make that <hi>fluid</hi> and <hi>ſubtle</hi> that before was <hi>groſs,</hi> or that <hi>volatile</hi> which before was <hi>fixt,</hi> or on the contrary.</p>
               <p>The mean of all (on <hi>Natures</hi> part) is <hi>Ferment,</hi> on the Artiſts part, the Application of due Agents and Patients, and external heat according to the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the thing required,</p>
               <p>By theſe means is ſought the hidden virtue of the <hi>Concrete,</hi> and made to appear openly, which is ſo far beyond the <hi>Concrete</hi> in vertue, as it was in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51297:20"/>its crude ſimplicity, as the beſt wine is before the crude juice of grapes in excellency.</p>
               <p>For although ſome things have their vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to their form, depending on the <hi>vita ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> of the ſubject, as is eſpecially apparent in all things, which work magnetically, yet ſeriouſly in the vaſt Catalogue of ſimples, how few things are of uſe without praevious preparation or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, either their groſs corporality, or their virulent malignity, being an obſtinate obſtacle to their effectual Energie: for the Corporeous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, it is taken away by <hi>Diſſolution,</hi> and <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tization,</hi> in which two operations for the moſt part all the malignitie of the ſubject is either taken away or ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>For the fire as it cleanses that which was foul, ſo it ripens that which was crude, it digeſts what was virulent, and inverts its malignity; making it appear with new qualities, and by means of it is the virtue of ſomthing exalted, and made more noble by a thouſand fold.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the fire alone is but the Deſtroyer of ſeminal virtue, and whatever it maſters, it doth not only extinguiſh the ſame, but it doth alter it nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into ſtrange Heterogeneities, in which that eminent <hi>Craſis</hi> (of which we boaſt) is not to be ſeen, therefore have the Sons of Art invented and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared means for the praevious diſſolution of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted bodies, by which means the bodies being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, the more noble parts may be ſevered from the ignoble and unactive, and by this their end is attained.</p>

               <p>Its name firſt given by <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in the Germane tongue, ſounding as much as all Spirit, <hi>Al-geheſt,</hi> may denote its nature; it is a ſpirit of ſo homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal a ſubſtance, that it is not to be altered in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except only by its compeer, by which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and loſeth its virtue being once joined and mixed with it.</p>
               <p>Of this I intend here to ſpeak very briefly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving elſewhere in a peculiar Treatiſe handled it ſufficiently, and cleerly, nor ſhall I in this place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what there is fully ſet down.</p>
               <p>Yet becauſe that our intent is here to give a ſhort Syſteme of the whole Art of <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> which cannot be, without this Liquour be treated of, ſince by means of it the moſt noble end eminent preparations are performed, therefore it behoves us not to neglect this ſo worthie a ſubject, leſt our work may appear, (and that moſt juſtly) to be lame and imperfect.</p>
               <p>This liquour then is no other then that fire, of

               <p>And firſt it will be neceſſary to remove a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which unremoved may derogate much from the eſteem of what I am now about to write, and that is, that I may not be accounted a writer at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For from my tender years I alwaies coveted true <hi>Philoſophy</hi> above all attainments, not valuing any thing in the World comparably therewith.</p>
               <p>For this <hi>I was willing to ſpend and to be ſpent.</hi> and to the glorie of Gods grace be it ſpoken, he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo far to be propitious to me (though infinitely unworthie,) that he diſcovered unto me many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, hidden &amp; concealed from moſt of thoſe vvho ſeek after theſe miſteries, not beleeved by others, though the <hi>Learned men</hi> (ſo eſteemed) of the vvorld.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Encomium</hi> therefore of this ſo worthie a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, I think fit to begin in the words of noble <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> In Nature, ſaith he, there is but one <hi>fire,</hi> which is our conſuming <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which is originally in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and therfore producible by Art, as to wit, when by ſtriking of the <hi>flint</hi> &amp; <hi>ſteel</hi> together, it is made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in its <hi>ſparks,</hi> which being taken in <hi>tinder,</hi> are by an eaſie art (known to each Kitchinmaid) multiplied into a <hi>fire</hi> as big as the maker of it pleaſeth, which at firſt though out a <hi>Spark,</hi> yet being cheriſhed with <hi>Fuel</hi> proper to it, becomes in ſhort ſpace ſo great
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51297:22"/>a flame, as would be able to conſume whatever is combuſtible in the whole World, if it were put into it.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe there is but one Liquour compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Fire, yet far more powerful and vehement then the common flame: For thoſe things which will abide in this Fire, being not conquerable by it, are by the other fire deſtroied, and altered radically and fundamentally.</p>
               <p>This Fire being diſtilled from any mettal ſoft and imperfect doth at firſt time or ſecond, leave them in a fuſible ſubſtance like waxe, of which the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> or tincture is diſſolvable in the beſt Spirit of Wine, and from the reſidue (being kept three daies in a vapouring heat) ☿ quick and running may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; The ſame may be done in harder mettals, yea in the perfect mettals, in a longer time, by oftner reiterated cohobations.</p>
               <p>But if this Fire be once diſtilled from ☿ vulgar, it leaves it coagulated and fixed, ſo that it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the teſt of <hi>Saturne,</hi> It is left ſpongious like to a Pumice ſtone, but heavie like <hi>Turbith minerale,</hi> brittle, and therefore without difficultie pulveriſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which then cohobated with Water diſtilled from whites of Egges, it cauſeth that diſtilled water to ſtink, but becomes of the colour of the beſt Coral, whence it is denominated <hi>Arcanum Corallinum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fire if it be diſtilled from any Gem or ſtone ſubtilly pulverized, it turns into a meer Salt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual weight to the Jem or ſtone; Pearls it reſolves into a milk, which is their firſt <hi>Ens,</hi> ſo alſo Crabscies (as they are vulgarly called, being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe no eies, but ſtones found in the head of the Crab) and all vegetable ſtones, as Peach ſtones, dates ſtones, or the like.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:51297:22"/>
               <p>In a word, it doth reſolve all Vegetables, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals and Minerals into their firſt <hi>Ens,</hi> and in ſuch concretes as contain in them Heterogeneities, it doth diſcover and ſever, (that it makes ſeparable,) the ſame.</p>
               <p>The adviſe of this old Philoſopher, to all who had given up their Names to Art, is, that they ſhould with all their might endeavour to attain this Fire, if their aim were at Noble and more than vulgar Medicines; yet concludes it to be ſo hard and high an attainment, that not every ſearcher, but only ſuch as are choſen of God, ſhall be maſters of it; therefore that the Champions, (who with Induſtrie ſtrive for this Maſterie) be not diſcouraged with its difficultie, which is the greater, becauſe of the uncouth obſcurity of all who hitherto have handled this Subject, being chiefly <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and his great expoſitour <hi>Van Helmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall a little more particularly handle this hidden Myſterie in its effects, and properties, (ſuch to wit vvhich are to its ſelf peculiar, and to other diſſolving liquours incommunicable) by which means the ſigns and marks by vvhich it may be knovvn vvill be laid open, vvhich to a ſtudious Sonne of this Art vvill be an unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raleld guide and directorie, and therefore a Work very acceptable.</p>

               <p>Of theſe firſt are thoſe who indiſtinctly confound this Liquour with the ☿ of the Philoſophers, of which ſort I know many, who by no means will be beaten off from this conceit, then which there can be none more abſurd, if weighed in the ballance of right Reaſon.</p>
               <p>For firſt theſe two differ materially and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, the one being ☿ truly and properly ſo called, the other <hi>Salt,</hi> and is therefore called <hi>Sal circulatus major, Salium ſummus &amp; faeliciſsimus; Liquor Salis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly they differ formally and eſſentially, The one being not onely mettallick but a mettal, to wit Philoſophical, according to the Philoſopher, <hi>In metallis per metalla proficiuntur metalla,</hi> and according to the joint conſent of all maſters in that ſcience, who all conclude, that all the principles of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical <hi>Elixir</hi> are Homogeneal, coeſſential one to other, and therefore they do formally remain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51297:23"/>each with other, and are tranſmuted, ſo each into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers natures, that agents become paſſive, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents active in the progreſs of the great <hi>Elixir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Philoſoſophers water is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Aqua ſicca non madefaciens manus, nec quicquam hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mectans, niſi quod conveniat ſibi in materiae homogeneitate atque identitate;</hi> Nor is there any difference allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt perfect <hi>Gold,</hi> and the ☿ of the <hi>Magi,</hi> ſave only this, that one is ripe &amp; perfect, the other crude and imperfect: And <hi>Artephus,</hi> to put all out of doubt, ſaith it is the ☿ of Saturnine ♁, in which no met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal is diſſolved or drowned but Gold, and this he affirms to be the only Agent in the world for the Art.</p>
               <p>Alſo both he and <hi>Treviſan</hi> (to put this matter beyond all controverſie) conclude and poſitively determine, that for their work, there is not any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent profitable, which doth not formally abide with the diſſolved bodies, ſo as with them to becom one thing, as the moiſture of the ground doth with a grain of wheat which is diſſolved in it, and therfore reject as ſophiſtications all diſſolving liquors which are not permanent with the Bodies diſſolved, and which the bodies reſolved cannot recongeal with themſelves, ſo that the Philoſophical diſſolution of the body, doth cauſe at the ſame time, a congelation of the diſſolving ſpirit, that ſo they may be made one together, with an inſeparable <hi>Conjunction,</hi> for this, read <hi>Artephus</hi> his ſecret Book. Alſo Count <hi>Treviſan</hi> his book extant in the firſt <hi>vol.</hi> of <hi>Theatr. Chem.</hi> and his Epiſtle to <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Bononia</hi> extant in the 2. <hi>vol.</hi> of <hi>Ars Aurifera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas on the contrary the Liquour <hi>Alchabeſt</hi> is a real Water, which will wet either hand or any thing elſe; it will join with any Concretes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51297:24"/>in the whole World, not barely moiſtning them; but reſolving them, and remaining with them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, diſtilling over with them, in a fire of the ſecond degree in ſand, and yet radically mixing with nothing, being ſeparable from every thing, to which it is mixed in diſſolution, as Phlegme is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from 🝆 of <hi>Vitriol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe though it diſſolve <hi>Gold,</hi> yet doth it not abide with it when diſſolved; which is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite in all generations: therefore in brief we ſhall give the differences which are between the one and the other, and that as they appear in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, form, and operation.</p>
               <p>Philoſophers ☿ is Antimonial Saturnine Argent vive, a middle Subſtance, cleer like pure ſilver, <hi>(Artephus.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt,</hi> is a Salt of an exquiſite fiery nature, the like of which is not in the world beſide, not mineral nor metalline, circulated till it become a very Spirit, which is <hi>Algeheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Philoſophers ☿ wets not the hand, nor ought elſe that is not of its own (that is a metalline) nature, nor will it join with any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>The Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt</hi> wets the hand, or any thing beſides in the World, and will diſſolve each thing according to its kind, and reduce it to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive matter, and will mixe with it when diſſolved as a ſpirit with an Aquous flegme, but being not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically joined, is therefore ſeparable from all things that are diſſolved by it.</p>
               <p>In the Philoſophers ☿ <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> onely, is drowned, and the diſſolver and the diſſolved, after diſſolution, are united with an inſeparable union, ſo that of both is made one.</p>
               <p>In the Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt Gold</hi> and other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51297:24"/>ſubſtances are diſſolved, but it abides with none of them, nor is it altered by any of them.</p>
               <p>To conclude, the ſolution made by the ☿ of the Philoſophers is in a way of generation, not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the tincture from the ☿ <hi>all</hi> part, but conjoining them more firmely each to other, that both may grow up together to a Subſtance in its own kind multiplicable.</p>
               <p>But the ſolution made by the Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt</hi> is in a deſtructive way, extinguiſhing the ſeed, as to a generative power, for it divides betwixt the Tincture and the ☿, ſo as vvhen once ſevered they can never be united again, making the Tincture vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, which though then admirable, as to medicine, yet is it quite alienated from its metalline nature and diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up then this diſcourſe, vve conclude that though both the ☿ of the Philoſophers and this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour are very noble ſecrets, yet are they ſo diſtinct each from other, that one hath no dependance on the other, being in their matter, form, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, as much different, as can almoſt be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>Others there are, vvho conceive this Liquor, to be a Mercurial vvater (of vvhich number the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the <hi>Chemical Dictionary</hi> is one, theſe are his vvords, <hi>Alchaheſt, eſt</hi> ☿ <hi>optimè praeparatus contra hepatis obſtructiones</hi>) ſome vvould have it out of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> the Spirit of it, to vvit, mixed and circulated vvith the pure ſpirit of Wine; Some vvould have it to be a pure Spirit of Salt, not to mention dotards, vvho vvould have it to be an Aethereal Spiritual vvater, dravvn out of the Air, impregnated vvith an Eſurine Salt; others beleeve it to be a Spirit of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51297:25"/>true <hi>Nitre,</hi> which they diſtinguiſh from <hi>Saltpeter,</hi> but, I preſume, know not where to find it themſelvs, or to direct any body elſe to find it.</p>
               <p>For my part, I ſhall willingly admit, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that every one ſhould abound in his own judgement, nor am I careful what mens opinions concerning it are.</p>
               <p>This I know, that the ſubtilties which are oft in <hi>ſpeculative Theorie,</hi> prove dotages in <hi>practice,</hi> this my own experience hath to me put out of queſtion.</p>
               <p>The noble <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith poſitively, <hi>That in the whole World, as there is but one Fire, ſo there is but this one Liquour, nor any other that hath its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which the</hi> Adepti <hi>do know and can teſtifie,</hi> this (as Scholar) I beleeve, but to deal ingenuouſly, I know not how to demonſtrate to my ſelf, and yet am ſure, that ſuch a liquour which he deſcribes, I know to prepare.</p>
               <p>He affirms it alſo to be, <hi>taedioſiſsimae praeparationis, Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>de Lethiaſi,</hi> and in his chapter intituled <hi>Due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech reſolutum,</hi> where he teacheth the preparation of the <hi>Ludus</hi> into <hi>Altholizoim,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>This is almoſt difficult work, not in reſpect of the preparation of the</hi> Ludus, <hi>for that is done in two hours ſpace, but in reference to the making of the Liquour</hi> Alchaheſt, <hi>and for this</hi> he ſaith, <hi>the</hi> Adepti <hi>have a proof which goes beyond all demonſtration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This demonſtrable proof I muſt ſeriouſly profeſs is to me unknown, yet (as I ſaid) ſuch a liquour I know to prepare, that ſhall do all that this great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher attributes to his, but whether mine and his be in every reſpect one, as I cannot affirme, ſo I cannot deny it, yet I hope to prepare this which I know, in 50 ♁, nor ſhould I be out, if I ſhould ſay 40.</p>
               <p>Yet that, which firſt I did prepare, was done at
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51297:25"/>uncertainty, and therefore in making of it, as I oft erred, ſo (I preſume) I went alway the longeſt and furtheſt way to the Wood, beſides, expecting many errors, I wrought on much of the matter at once, that if one, two, or three trials ſhould fail, I might have matter ſufficient to begin again.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it being only a diſcoverie, I made it not my whole buſineſs, but attended things that I knew together with it, yet ſince I effected my propounded deſire, I conſidered my operations, and if my calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation be not amiſs, I know many Chemical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, more tedious then it, unleſs the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the work were accounted by <hi>Helmont</hi> on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſcore, then in reference to the time, which I rather beleeve, &amp; that is the noiſomneſs of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wrought on in its firſt preparations, which to one operator may be much more then another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the way he proceeds in his working and method he follows, or inſtruments he uſeth, for great variety may be herein, yet all tending to one end, but this onely by the by, I ſhall now come to the matter intended.</p>
               <p>This is a ponderous liquor, being indeed all <hi>Salt,</hi> without any wattie <hi>Phlegine,</hi> it is all volatile, being wholly a Spirit, without any corporietie left in it, of no eminent odour, for all things vvhich ſend out an odour conſiderable, are for the moſt part of a very volatile nature, or conſiſt of many heterogeneities Is is not therfore volatile after the manner of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, Vrine, or the like, vvhich flie vvith the ſmalleſt degree of heat, but (like unto a ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirit vvhich yeelds its flegm in the firſt place) this vvhen it hath diſſolved any vegetable concrete, and made it volatile, vvill ſuffer the ſame by a gentle heat of <hi>Baineum Mariae,</hi> to be all ſeparated
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51297:26"/>from it ſelf, and to aſcend in its various colours, leaving this diſſolving Liquour in the bottome of the Cucurbit, no vvhit vveakned in virtue, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in quantity.</p>
               <p>Thus is it an immortal <hi>Ens,</hi> that is, vvhoſe virtue is not exantlated, by reiterated acting upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, but retaining its vigour unaltered, it is of povver to reſolve bodies perpetually, being ſubject to Caſualty, but not to mutability, (ſaue onely by its compeer,) and is therefore vvorthily eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe vvho knovv it as an unparalelled myſterie.</p>

               <p>FRom vvhat hath been diſcovered, concerning this Liquours vvonderful Nature, it may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be imagined vvhat a Key this is into Phyſick and Philoſophie to ſuch as are maſters of the ſame.</p>
               <p>I need not to illuſtrate this, urge the admirable medicinal virtue that is in Metals and Mineral Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in Jems, Pearls, and Animal and Vegetable ſtones, for it doth reſolve alſo Vegetals into their firſt liquid matter, diſtinguiſhing in them all their heterogeneities, by ſeveral colours, and diſtinct places, one above another; in vvhich reſolution there alvvaies ſeats it ſelf in a diſtinct place a ſmall Liquour, eminently diſtinguiſhable from the reſt in Colour, in vvhich the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the vvhole Herb, tree, or ſeed doth reſide.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51297:26"/>
               <p>In vvhich retrogradation of the Concrete, by this vvay of diſſolution, there is no loſs of virtue, but an exalting of the ſame by many degrees, only vvhatever virulencie is in the Crude concrete, by this operation is vvholly extinct, vvith a preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notvvithſtanding of all ſpecifick virtues appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Concrete in its ſimplicitie.</p>
               <p>Theſe preparations, (I doubt not but) you vvill in your mind highly commend, and vviſh vvith your ſelf, that you could make the like, and to ſay Truth, they are eminent and very deſirable, but
<q>Velle ſuum cuique eſt, nec voto vivitur uno.</q> If you vviſh the thing and be vviſe, vviſh alſo the means of attaining it, and that is vvith induſtrie ſet about it, ſo ſhal you be able to reſolve al Herbs into their principles, liquid vvithout ſediment, of vvhich part vvill be unctuous and fat, eſpecially in Trees, Gums, Seeds, and many Roots, and part aqueous, in vvhich the volatile Salt of the Concrete vvill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the taſt, the Liquour vvith its ovvn Oil, you may circulate into an eſſential Salt, vvhich is indeed the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of the Concrete, but if you vvould have things done in a leſſer time, make your diſſolutions in a ſtronger heat, and diſtil over your Liquour vvith the diſſolved Bodie, in a due fire, ſo vvill the Oilineſs be vvholly turned into a ſaline Spirit, vvhich in a diſtillation by Bath, vvill come over in various Colours, the <hi>Craſis</hi> ſeparating it ſelf from the Flegme, (both by colour, taſt, and ſmell, as alſo by its time of coming over the <hi>Helme</hi> diſtinguiſhable,) and your Liquour left behind at bottom, as much in quantity, and as effectual in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as before.</p>
               <p>Thus, out of <hi>Hellebore</hi> may be made a noble ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick againſt the Gout, the Hypocondriack melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly

Of vvhich <hi>Helmont</hi> commends the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> of the <hi>Cedar</hi> for long life, and next to it the <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> provided it be prepared by diſſolution in a gentle heat, like to the heat of the Sun in the Spring, and after that digeſted in a like heat till the Oil and Water be united, into an eſſential <hi>Salt,</hi> I ſhould adviſe all <hi>Vegetables</hi> to be prepared in the like Nature, if you deſire to have their eminent Virtue, vvithout loſing thoſe peculiar excellencies vvhich depend on the <hi>vita ultima</hi> of the Concrete, othervviſe a ſpeedier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration makes the Medicine no leſs effectual for curing diſeaſes, though leſs povverful as to long life.</p>
               <p>Yet although the bleſſing of long life, may be found in the vegetable familie, by means of this Liquour, in vvhich reſpect theſe concretes deſerve an high eſtimation, yet is there nothing compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of ſuch medicinal efficacie, in theſe prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as is in metalline extracts, vvhich perform that in cure, vvhich to all vegetable means is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>Of theſe I purpoſe to ſpeak but briefly, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more thorough diſcoverie of them to better times; for to deal ingenuouſly, I have travelled in theſe ſearches, as Iſrael did to the promiſed land, through a Wilderneſs of Difficulties, ſtraits, and croſſes, all cauſed through Gods permiſſion, by the malice of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and the envie of unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51297:27"/>men, inſomuch that from the firſt time, that I was ſo happy as to ſee my labour in theſe ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches crowned with ſucceſs, to this very day, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had conveniency of reiterating theſe operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but have lived contented, that if ever God pleaſed to make me ſo happy as to be this way ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to mankind, he would grant me opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, which hitherto I have wanted, and at preſent injoy not, if otherwiſe, bleſſed be his name, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſtowed on me talents, and finding me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, hath made me unſerviceable to others, and unprofitable to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>In this Liquour many things I have ſeen, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things I know by <hi>Analogy,</hi> and am confirmed of them by what I have read and meditated, and it may ſuffice any ingenuous man, that what I write I know to be true, by experimental ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, then which no teſtimony on earth can be more certain.</p>
               <p>Come we then from the Vegetable to the mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kingdom, in which our Liquour doth approve it ſelf, and may juſtly be eſteemed the <hi>Phiſitians crown</hi> and the <hi>Philoſophers Diadem,</hi> by means of which all diſeaſes, though never ſo deplorable, may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and cut down, as hay, or weeds with a Sith in the hand of a Mower.</p>
               <p>And here we might take a ſurvey of what it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects on mettals; then on minerals; and laſtly on <hi>Salts, Stones, Pearls, Corals, &amp;c.</hi> All which we could repreſent as in a ſmal map, or Landskip, but that we are unwilling to have this ſmall Treatiſe ſwell into a voluminous bulk.</p>
               <p>The King of mettals, <hi>Gold,</hi> of Nature moſt fixed, that endures, without the leaſt diminution, the moſt exquiſite trials of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> yet if Calcined

               <p>This is the higheſt preparation of <hi>Gold</hi> that can be made by means of this Liquour, being its fift Eſſence, and is of power to cure the moſt deplorable diſeaſes, to which the nature of Man is ſubject. But the magiſtery of <hi>Gold,</hi> which is the firſt preparation of it, by means of this Liquour, is a most eminent Medicine, againſt all <hi>Malignant Fevers,</hi> the <hi>Pestilence, Palſies, Plagues, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Calcine good <hi>Vitriol</hi> till it be thoroughly waſted, what will waſt, then dulcifie the Colchotar with pure Water, and drie it, to this dried, put an equal part of this Liquour, for it will be diſſolved eaſily and ſpeedily, diſtill off your liquour, and pour it back again, and thus cohobate it, at the leaſt twelve or fifteen times, ſo vvill all the Bodie of the <hi>Colchotar</hi> be brought over the <hi>Helme,</hi> in form of a green liquour, digeſt this fame, in a gentle heat,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51297:28"/>of <hi>a Bath,</hi> for about a month, and then diſtill it in a ſlow fire, ſo will the whole Metalline ſubſtance of the <hi>Venus,</hi> come over, leaving the Liquour below in the bottome of the Retort, in its intite <hi>pondus</hi> and Virtue. To this Liquour or Spirit, put an equal quantitie of 🜹, diſſolved in as much water, as will diſſolve it, ſo ſhall you ſeparate the green Liquour from a white ſediment, which white ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment will give white mettal, as fixed as <hi>Silver,</hi> and which will abide the teſt of ♄, but yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally diſtinct from <hi>Silver,</hi> which thou (if a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher) ſhalt eaſily perceive, however as good to a Metallurgiſt, as the beſt <hi>Silver,</hi> the green Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour drie up in a viol glaſs, by evaporating all the moiſture, for it is the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the ♀, mixed with the 🜹, by which (note that) it is fixed, ſo that it will abide all Fire, this <hi>Sulphur</hi> extract with the moſt pure Spirit of <hi>Wine,</hi> which will diſſolve it, leaving the 🜹, diſtil away then from it (thus diſſolved) your Spirit of Wine, and you have left a very fragrant green Oil of ♀, which is its <hi>Sulphur</hi> eſſenſificated, by theſe operations, as ſweet to taſt as the beſt Honie, then which Nature hath not a more ſoverain remedie, for moſt (not to ſay all) diſeaſes: This is the true <hi>Nepenthe</hi> of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, cauſing certain Reſt, and aſſwaging all pains, but ever after ſleep, leaving the pattie, either ſenſibly amended, (in more violent and diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſeaſes) or quite well, in leſs rigid maladies.</p>
               <p>Of this ſubject I can write more experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally; and upon ☿, as alſo on <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and ♁, as being of no great value, though when prepared of moſt tranſcendent virtues, I ſhall be able when I make this Liquour again, to give a larger diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it, being unwilling to be a relatour, of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51297:29"/>what I have on truſt from others, but what I in truth know my ſelf: So much I have ſeen as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth me, both of the exiſtencie and of the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of this Liquour, nor doe I conceive it ſo long, or ſo tedious in making, of which I purpoſe to ſatisfie my ſelf (God permitting) ſhortly, for if it were ſo tedious to make, and caſual in making, neither <hi>Helmont</hi> nor <hi>Paracelſus</hi> could try ſo many experiments with it: Sure I am, that what I made, and was the reſult of many years tryals, (off and on) but of nigh two years almoſt daily (I am ſure weekly) ſearch, though I was choice of it, yet, my care notwithſtanding, my glaſs (once in diſtilling) broke, and my skill was at an end, as to practiſe, but during the time it was in my cuſtody, it was not idle night nor day: For Magiſteries I made many, but was moſtly unhappy in Quinteſſences, partly becauſe I was haſtie, and would have things done faſter then Nature allowed, at laſt being about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect my <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> as I deſcribed, I broke my glaſs, and loſt both one and other, being both Volatile.</p>
               <p>But it is ſafer to make Magiſteries, that is, to diſſolve the Metalline <hi>Calxes,</hi> and then draw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Liquour, and if you pleaſe to repeat this three or four times in hard Mettals, then have you the Mettal or Mineral left, like a ſweet <hi>Salt,</hi> of a fragrant ſent, potable in any Liquour, and which will yeeld its tincture, if diſſolved in pure Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>However, if you have ſure furnaces, that will give heat to your mind, then proceed on, not only to the making mettals potable, but alſo volatile, ſeparate then the Central ☿ from the Tincture,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51297:29"/>which is the <hi>Oil</hi> or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and fix this, as is taught concerning the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſo you have medicines, which will effect whatever can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by either Patient or Doctour.</p>
               <p>I ſhould eaſily here, (if I ſhould follow the dictate of my <hi>Genius</hi>) run out into a large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, but I ſhould then prejudice and lame a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which is concerning this Liquour in Latine, which was chiefly written, while my Trials were in the very working, and which I purpoſe, ſhall ere long ſee the light, in which Reader (if thou canſt but attain the Liquor) thou maiſt abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be inſtructed how to uſe it, and ſo I ſhall end this diſcourſe, and come to the laſt thing on this ſubject promiſed by me, and I preſume expected by thee, and that is, to declare the matter of it, and its man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making,</p>

               <p>THis Secret ſo efficacious, and ſo wonderful as it it is of unſpeakable uſe when found, ſo it hath found in the World many who have attempted the attainment of the ſame, &amp; not without good reaſon ſince being attained it abundantly recompenſeth the pains, &amp; coſt laid out upon it, in its <hi>virtue</hi> &amp; <hi>uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as it is in all things, which are ſought in the univerſe ſo is it in this, there is no endeavour profitable, unleſs the ſearch be made firſt <hi>In debita materia,</hi> and nextly, <hi>Per debita media.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:51297:30"/>
               <p>It is not every new thing, nor yet every ſtrange thing, that is, or may be made, that will, when produced, prove to be this Liquour, No verily; let the Artiſt work his pleaſure, yet will not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tranſgreſs her own known rules, to make what the Operatour in his Idle Phantaſie ſhall expect, but that onely to which ſhe is bound by the Law of the Creatour.</p>
               <p>Now from this maſtery, We ſhall exclude firſt, all mettalls, and metalline Bodies, for firſt, as to the Central ☿ of them, as it is a peerleſs Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo it is commiſcible with nothing in the World, but is a ſingle, indeſtructible <hi>Ens,</hi> which being a real ☿, will not wet any thing, but that which is Homogeneous to it ſelf (that is) ☿ <hi>al,</hi> and ſo is not the Liquour of it ſelf, nor can be by any Art mixed with ought elſe, either by <hi>Sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Diſſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as for the <hi>Sulphurs</hi> of Metals, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated radically from the <hi>Mercurial Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> without this Liquours help, and ſo would come too ſlowly in, to be the matter of that, which muſt be perfected, ere they can be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and had.</p>
               <p>Now for mineral combuſtible <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> as they are very ſluggiſh unactive Bodies, ſo they cannot be really altered in their Nature, but they are made paſſive medicaments, not active <hi>Menſtrues,</hi> though theſe paſſive Medicaments, as to the cure of diſeaſes, are mightily operative, yet as to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutive virtue, in reference to bodies, that they have not, (unleſs burnt,) and ſo they yeeld an acid Liquour.</p>
               <p>We are therefore excuſed from mineral and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline <hi>Sulphurs</hi> and ☿ <hi>es,</hi> now as for metalline Salts,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51297:30"/>they alſo are to our purpoſe muſeful, ſince all of them (none excepted) yeeld an acid Spirit, and ſo are contradiſtinct from our Liquour, which is not acid, for ſo it could nor be immutable in acting, according to the true rule in Chemical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, which is, <hi>Omnis acidus Spiritus corrodendo corpus ipſe fatiſcit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Liquour then being no acid, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct Spirit from acidity, we reject from it <hi>Salt Peter, Vitriol, Sal Gem, Sea Salt,</hi> and in a word, all <hi>Salts</hi> naturally growing in the earth, or extracted out of the Earth, which all (none excepted) yeeld an acid Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> may, above all that are named, claim the praecminence, and truly they deſerve it; their Spirits not being acid, and therefore they are diſſolvents next to the great Liquour, of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eſteem, of which hereafter we ſhall treat at large.</p>
               <p>Yet theſe alſo, though moſt noble Spirits, doe notwithſtanding ſpend their virtue in diſſolving Bodies, and are Coagulated upon them, into a Salt (yet retaining its volatility,) We therefore exclude them from being the Subject of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour.</p>
               <p>To be brief therefore in what I intend, I ſhall come to the matter indeed, and with it ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the practice of the Liquours preparation.</p>
               <p>It is by <hi>Helmont</hi> called <hi>Latex,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefacta eſt Religio reperto Latice, qui, &amp;c.</hi> In which place becauſe the whole miſterie is in few vvords couched, I ſhall become a Candid Interpreter of his aenigmatical Senſe and meaning.</p>
               <p>He firſt ſaith, <hi>Ars indagando ſollicita eſt corpori quod tantae puritatis Symphonia colluderet noblſcum ut a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpente
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51297:31"/>nequiret diſsipari, &amp;c.</hi> which we may thus render in Engliſh, <hi>The Maſter-peece at which our Art is level'd, is to find out a Body, which may play with us in ſuch a Symphony, or conſenting Harmony, by reaſon of its exquiſite purity, that no corruptive prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple can find in it any Heterogeneities by which to work in it a diſſipation of parts.</hi> This is the true ſenſe of that Paragraph, and indeed is a brief, but very full Deſcription or Determination of the higheſt object, and the unparallel'd Maſter-peece of out Art, For it is our (or the <hi>Chemical</hi>) <hi>Art</hi> that is ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous about this diſcoverie, the <hi>Logician</hi> (mean while) minding his <hi>Categories, Enunciations, Moods, Figures,</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrations, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi> his <hi>Criticiſmes</hi> in Languages, the <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> the <hi>Courſe</hi> of the <hi>Planets,</hi> and the <hi>ſuuation</hi> of the <hi>ſixed Stars:</hi> but the honeſt conſcionable <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> he minds the recovering of ſick perſons, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of maladies, which that he may perform, his ſearch is after the ſecret hidden Spirit of things, for the extracting and exalting of which, he laies out with diligence to attain the means, and thoſe are, this Body, here hinted in this forerecited Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph, and our immortal liquour, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Body.</p>
               <p>This body is neither ſingly fixt, nor volatile, but both, one ſubſtance of two diſtinct Natures, and eſſences, which is not obſcurely gatherable out of the words themſelves, which ſound thus, <hi>That a Body is ſought, which may collude with us, or make ſport, play, or game with us in the Symphony, or conſenting ſound of ſo great purity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Word <hi>Symphony</hi> is but a borrowed <hi>metaphor</hi> from Muſicians, from whom this Author borrows oft eſpecially when he diſcovers and deſcribes theſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51297:31"/>
                  <hi>Alchaheſtical</hi> operations, as for inſtance, where ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the grand <hi>Arcana</hi>'s, and their operation, he uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>That they do perform their Cures in Tono uniſono,</hi> alluding to inſtruments of Muſick, which when tuned to <hi>Vniſons,</hi> do then ſound in the moſt perfect concord, being in unity, al other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords being but approaching ſteps to that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to this a ſecond, which is the moſt abſolute diſcord, is contradiſtinct.</p>
               <p>But as a <hi>Symphony</hi> muſt alwaies be imagined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two notes at leaſt, ſo this <hi>Metaphor</hi> denotes a duality of qualities in this <hi>Body,</hi> which yet muſt conſent together in <hi>Harmony,</hi> this is a <hi>Coſounding</hi> or <hi>Symphony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the duality is not in the <hi>Body,</hi> but in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of qualities under which this one <hi>body</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, the words are proof enough, therefore ſaith the Old Philoſopher, <hi>Sollicita eſt Ars (indagando cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pori, non indagandis corporibus)</hi> which muſt have been ſaid, if various <hi>Bodies</hi> had been to be taken for this maſtery, as is the judgement of ſome, who would have ☿ and <hi>Tartar,</hi> with ſeveral other bodies to be uſed for this vvork, but out of this Hotchpotch can be expected nothing, but a liquour moſt certainly vveakned much, if not vvholly deſtroied, as to any active Virtue, by Reaſon of this irrational mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>It is a Body then (not bodies) which <hi>Art</hi> deſires to ſave her longing in this particular, and ſuch a Body, vvhich being one in eſſence and radically, ſhevvs to ſight diſtinguiſhed into a tvvofold diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yet only diſtinct in qualities or complexion, but agreeing ſo fundamentally, as being touched by an Artiſts hand, may in an Artiſts ear make a muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Harmonie and melodie.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51297:32"/>
               <p>Of this body, vvhich is one in eſſence or kind, tvvo in number or apparency, may be ſaid, that vvhich <hi>Hermes</hi> in another (but very like) caſe ſaid of the ☿ of Philoſophers and its compeer, <hi>That which is above is like to that which is beneath, and that below like to that which is aloſt, &amp; all to the production or making out the miracles of one thing:</hi> This is our firſt diſcoverie, concerning the matter of this noble Liquour (vvhich engrave in your mind) that it muſt be one Body in Kind and Realitie, diſtinct vvith tvvo faces, that is, ſuperficially and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently.</p>
               <p>Nor is this body eaſie to be found our and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, of vvhich the voords are a plentiful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vvhich run thus, <hi>Ars indagando ſollicita eſt corpori, Art is ſollicitous, or carefull or ſedulouſly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, about finding out ſuch a Body:</hi> Where obſerve likevviſe that the vvord vvhich is put for finding, ſignifies ſuch a finding as is made by ſtudious ſearch and inquiry, as a hound that follovvs upon the ſent of the Foot, is properly ſaid, thus to find his game, being compounded of <hi>inde</hi> and <hi>ago,</hi> and ſignifies an unceſſant acting upon knovvn grounds, till the thing propounded for to be found be attained; and this is our next diſcoverie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter of this noble Liquour, vvhich leſſon I adviſe you ſo to imprint in your mind, as not to let it ſlip.</p>
               <p>A third thing in this Body, vvhich is very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable is, that as it is tvvo numerically, to be found vvith pains and induſtrie, yea and vvith difficultie, ſo is it alſo admirable vvhen found, enough to puzzle reaſon, and nonplus ſenſe, to conſider hovv ſuch a Body ſhould be in ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as it is diſcovered to lie in; Therefore the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51297:32"/>profound Philoſopher adds, <hi>Tandem flupefacta eſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio reperto latice, &amp;c.</hi> It brings the Artiſt to a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſtoniſhment to conſider vvhat he hath found and inforceth him to cry out, <hi>O Lord, how wonderful art thou in thy works, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thing vvhen found, the diſcovery vvhen made, may truly be ſaid to be the vvork of God, and not of man, <hi>Who can bring</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob</hi>) <hi>a clean thing out of an unclean pure out of impure?</hi> this God alone muſt doe.</p>
               <p>Here are Riddles enough to amaze and amuſe, both our reaſon and our ſenſe, that a ſubject ſo loathſome ſhould yeeld a body ſo pure, that vvhat in its felf is ſo <hi>Proteus</hi> like, and mutable, that nothing can be more, ſhould give an <hi>Ens</hi> ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; Here is requiſite a Chemical faith to beleeve this before ſight, vvhich after ſight, vvill aſtoniſh reaſon to contemplate it.</p>
               <p>Not much unlike is this Miſterie to the miracle of the Creation, vvhere out of the inform <hi>Abyſse</hi> did ſpring ſo many, ſo rare, ſo admirable formes: out of the Boſome of the dark rude <hi>Chaos,</hi> did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all that glorie, and excellencie of beauty that did after appear in the matchleſs Paradice, Nor is there to reaſon leſs likelyhood, in this peerleſs production, where the ſubject is as unlikely as a man could Imagine, no marvel then if Art be ſo ſollicitous in this inquirie, to find ſuch a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as this, (ſince it ſearches for it vvhere it doth) vvhich muſt be ſo pure and indiſſolvable an <hi>Ens,</hi> ſo efficacious in its activitie, and ſo permanent in its virtue.</p>
               <p>To recollect our ſelves therefore, and to ſee vvhere vve are, here to vvit, that vve have found the Subject in vvhich this <hi>Ens</hi> lies hidden ſo invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51297:33"/>as that it requires in a mannet a Solifidian, to beleeve its exiſtency, but with induſtrie it is to be attained, and made viſible and apparent, and then is ſo incredibly differing from the ſubject in which it was couched, that it raiſeth an admiration in the Artiſt to contemplate the effect.</p>
               <p>And yet if the briefneſs of this Treatiſe would permit, I could eaſily ſilence this admiration, with the contemplation of the like, if not leſs probable productions, ſince out of the boſome of corruption all generations do ſpring forth, but that my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded purpoſe calls me off; as ſpeedily as may be, I having task ſufficient to perform; after this is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo great, to wit, as will ſwell this Treatiſe to a bulk beyond what I intended.</p>
               <p>A fourth thing therefore that falls under our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in this diſcoverie is, that this <hi>Body</hi> being ſingle, contemneth all mixtures with any ferment.</p>
               <p>And inaſmuch as Ferment is <hi>Parens tranſmutatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> ſince this <hi>Body</hi> will admit no marriage with any other Ferment, it is therefore the waſhing of a <hi>black More,</hi> to attempt its tranſmutation.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is rendred, For that it cannot find, <hi>Dignius ſe corpus cui nuberet.</hi> The means operative by which it attains this dignitie, and peculiar emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, is by reduction <hi>Ad Atomos minimos in Natura poſsibiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus is this <hi>Latex,</hi> which is vile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, advanced to tranſcendent height of puritie, and perfection, which Word is ſoon ſaid, not ſo ſoon underſtood, but hardeſt of all to be done</p>
               <p>This operarion is in few words taught by <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus,</hi> where he ſaith in his Treatiſe <hi>De Viribus mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hrorum, Cap. de Hepate,</hi> The Proceſs of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaheſt</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:51297:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>is <hi>(ut à Coagulatione ſua reſolvatur, ac deinde Coaguletur in formam tranſmutatam, ſicut proceſſus coagulandi &amp; reſolvendi docet, &amp;c.)</hi> which ſhort proceſs, is the greateſt light that acute Philoſopher gives concerning this miſterie no marvel then if its doctrine hath remained ſo obſcure in the World to this day.</p>
               <p>Nor is <hi>Helmonts</hi> Doctrine much more plain, this being their intent to write ſo as not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, intending their precepts ſhould be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as goads to young Artiſts to ſtir them up to a ſerious inquiry after ſuch things, which they onely gave hints of, but leaving the diſcovery of all to God only, who will be the diſpencer of theſe his gifts even to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>But I have reſolved much more apert Candidnes, knowing how profitable this ſecret would be, if more commonly known unto the Sons of men, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have ſo far adventured the Cenſure of al pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future Artiſts, as to diſcover theſe miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with much more openneſs then every yet hath been done.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to our task propoſed, vvhich is the explication of that place of <hi>Helmont,</hi> vvhich of all his vvritings, doth moſt fully teach the Matter and manner of making of the Liquour <hi>Alcha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt,</hi> of vvhich We have unfolded part, in vvhat We have already vvritten.</p>
               <p>Which that vve may recollect, in order to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>progreſs,</hi> this in brief is his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> concerning that Liquour, It is a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> appearing in tvvo forms, yet reducible to ſuch a <hi>Symphony,</hi> that it is not corruptible for the future, it is found in a <hi>Latex,</hi> by curious and diligent ſearch, and conſidering the ſubject in vvhich it lies, it vvould aſtoniſh a man to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51297:34"/>Contemplate its Nature, as it is, when perfected by Art, and ſo it is in its original matter, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of contempt, and in its exaltation an object of wonder.</p>
               <p>For finding afterwards, no body more noble then it ſelf to join withall, it is not commiſcible with any ferment, and ſo not capable of tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Now that which is added, <hi>Sed labor Sophiae anoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in natura fecit,</hi> is but only a further illuſtration of what had been ſaid before; for the whole that is ſaid of this Liquour, may very aptly be reduced to four heads.</p>
               <p>The firſt is what the Artiſt deſires: and is comprehended in theſe vvords, <hi>Ars indagando ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licita eſt corpori, quae tantae puritatis Symphoniâ collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret nobiſcum, ut à corrumpente nequiret diſsipari,</hi> This is the ſumme of vvhat the Artiſt vvould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and is the chief of all vvhich can be by art ſought for.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, What Art by induſtrie doth find, comprehended in theſe Words, <hi>Et tandem ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facta est Religio, reperto Latice, qui ad minimos re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductus Atomos in Natura poſsibiles, caelebs, omnis fermenti Connubia ſperneret. Deſperata eſt ergo ejus tranſmutatio dignius ſe Corpus non reperiens cui nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third diſcovers the Anomality of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, in theſe vvords, <hi>Sed Ars Sophiae anomalum in Natura produxit, quod abſque fermento commiſcibili a ſe diverſo ſurrexit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth contains a ſhort adumbration of the proceſs, in theſe vvords, <hi>Serpens iſle ſeipſum momordit à veneno revixit, &amp; mori deinceps neſcit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus vve have diſcovered unto us this Liquour
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51297:34"/>in its ſubject matter, vvhich is a <hi>Latex,</hi> in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction mediate, vvhich is a body of tvvo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, betvvixt vvhich in the end muſt be a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony,</hi> ſo to cauſe incorruptibility, in its final production, vvhich is a Subject uncapable of fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and beyond the poſſibilitie of tranſmutation (this to be underſtood vvith due limitation:) novv let us couſider vvhat is added, <hi>Sed Labor Sophiae anomalum in Natura ſecit, &amp;c.</hi> But the labour of Philoſophie hath brought forth an anomalous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in nature, vvhich took its being vvithout mixture of any ferment, Heterogeneous to it ſelf. <hi>This ſerpent hit it ſelf, revived from that Venome, and is from thence forth immortal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Anomalitie of this Generation, vvould require a ſull Treatiſe to unfold and lay open, in this place I ſhall therefore diſcover it but briefly.</p>
               <p>It is Anomalous, firſt in its operations, That any Agent in the World ſhould act vvithout repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (though to Heavenly Bodies natural, yet) vvith Sublunary Creatures it is unuſual, except <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and this Liquour.</p>
               <p>It is Anomalous in its matter, for <hi>the tree</hi> (uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) <hi>is known by its fruit,</hi> and the matter by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but here it is othervviſe, for this product is immortal, moſt pure, and incorruptible, though the matter of it be of all in the World moſt corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, impure, and mutable.</p>
               <p>It is Anomalous in its manner of production, for it ſelf becomes ferment to it ſelf, ſo that vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out addition of ought, but vvhat is of it ſelf, this ſo ſtrange an <hi>Ens</hi> is produced.</p>
               <p>The means of its production is by reiterated ſolution, and an intervening coagulation, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51297:35"/>thus is the Subject brought to the moſt ſubtle A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, of vvhich in Nature it is Capable.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Serpents biting of it ſelf,</hi> being indeed nothing but a Serpent comparatively, vvhich begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at its <hi>tail,</hi> by degrees devours it felf, and at laſt is renevved into a pure eſſence, over vvhich Death hath no povver.</p>
               <p>Of its mortality, and immortality, hovv both are true concerning it, I might largely diſpute, and enlarge this Diſcourſe upon the Subject, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſvvelling Volume, but the brevity at firſt propoſed to my ſelf, and promiſed to the Reader, calls me off, and my intended task minds me vvith vvhat ſpeed I can, to paſs forvvard to that vvhich is behind.</p>

               <p>THus have I (Courteous Readers) vvith much Ingenuitie, endeavoured to unmask unto you Nature in her Phyſical and medicinal ſecrets, ſhevved you the true vvay and means of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe diſquiſitions, ſo as to be fucceſsful in them, having taught the neceſſity of Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Keies, vvithout vvhich nothing can be done in this Art, of vvhich the nobleſt of all the Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt,</hi> We vvould not paſs over in ſilence, but as becomes a true Interpreter of Nature gave it its due dignity of precedency, as being the nobleſt,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51297:35"/>and moſt eminent of all <hi>Keys,</hi> more univerſal (in its operation) then the ☿ of the Philoſophers which is but a particular thing, applicable only to its own kind, and that in reference to a generative multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of <hi>Species,</hi> whereas this Liquour acts u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally, and without limitation on all the ſubjects in the vvhole world, which it deſtroies as to their <hi>vita ultima,</hi> and perfectly reduceth to their firſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in whith their eminent virtue is found, by which means thoſe noble Medicines may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, of which both <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> glory, nor without cauſe, ſithence by them may be cured all the infirmities incident to the Body of man, and ſo the life vindicated from the danger of diſeaſes, which by any one of thoſe great <hi>Arcana</hi> are conquered, and cut down, as Hay or Graſs with a Sith.</p>
               <p>It is a thing very deſirable to have thoſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines at command, and who would not be willing (though with great pains and coſt) to purchaſe the <hi>Horizontal Gold,</hi> which being taken inwardly with a few <hi>doſes,</hi> cureth the moſt deſperate diſeaſes, either inward or outward, to which mans Nature is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the <hi>Leproſie, Gout, Palſey, Epilepſie, Cancers, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulaes, Wolves, Scorbute, Kingse vil, venereal diſeaſe, &amp;c.</hi> and with one <hi>doſe,</hi> cures all <hi>Fevers,</hi> and <hi>Agues,</hi> the <hi>Hectick</hi> only excepted, which it cures in a month, as alſo any ſort of <hi>Conſumption,</hi> and (in a word) is a perfect remedy for any maladie, prevailing over all, but death, (which yet by curing all the miſeries of life, which reach the health,) it makes leſs truculent and dreadful.</p>
               <p>I need not inſtance in the <hi>Glorified Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> otherwiſe named the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the Philoſophers, nor in the <hi>Arcanum Corallinum,</hi> the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51297:36"/>glorified <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the <hi>Metallus maſculus,</hi> by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus</hi> called, his <hi>Vinum Vitae,</hi> and <hi>Membrorum eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> nor in the ☿ of life, the <hi>Lili</hi> of ♁, nor in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, of which the Catalogue would be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to give, which the ſtudious Reader may find in both <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> all which as being ſo many precious Iewels (having this Key,) he may (unlocking Natures Cabinet) command at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for it is but to tantalize a Reader, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to him what he is ſcarce likely to attain, and ſurely ſuch is this ſecret, which ſcarce the hundredth thouſand Artiſt may or ſhall be maſter of, nor any but ſuch only whom the Almighty by a more then ordinary grace ſhall bring thereto. I would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſh (if it ſo ſeemed good to the Almightie) that this Secret were more commonly known then it is, But I dare not preſcribe Rules to the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> knowing that he only will be the Diſpenſet of this <hi>Talent,</hi> unto the Worlds end; nor ſhall any attain unto it whom he by a peculiar grace, ſhall not bring unto this knowledge, foraſmuch as it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but onely in the bleſſing of the Lord, that ſuch ſecrets are revealed to ſuch as he hath choſen: To him only be everlaſting praiſe, and dominion, and eternal benediction. Yet would I adviſe with <hi>Helmont,</hi> that as many as deſire to be maſters of the more noble <hi>Arcana</hi>'s in Medicine, ſhould with all their might endeavour the attainment of that ſecret fire ſo much eſteemed, for its almoſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous virtue and effects, of which may be ſaid, <hi>Vulgus igne cremet, nos aquâ,</hi> and doubtleſs he that will be induſtrious and diligent may be pains taking and praier perfect his deſires, to the glory of God, his own comfort, and the relief of many thouſands.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:51297:36"/>
               <p>Yet would I not adviſe any young Artiſt to make this Secret the beginning of his Chemical Studies as many doe, of which fault my ſelf was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, for this is but a prepoſterous courſe of ſearching into Natures ſecrets. This being indeed as it were the Corollary or Topſtone of Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Art, (not to vie this Secret with the Medicine of the <hi>Magi,</hi> their <hi>Aurum potabile;</hi> attained by means of their Stone,) now, who but a madman being to climb up a Ladder, will begin at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt round, and refuſe the lower ſteps, reſolving not to ſtep one ſtep, unleſs he may at firſt reach the uppermoſt of all, ſo mad is he, who would devote himſelf to the ſtudie of true Medicine, and yet will account nothing worth his inquirie, except it be the Maſterie of <hi>Hermes,</hi> or this peerleſs Key, the Liquour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which prepoſterous practiſe, that I may ſeriouſly dehort thee (whoever thou art) a ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beginner in the Diſcoverie of, and inquitie after Natures ſecrets: conſider with me that all the works of Nature, are concatenate or linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch admirable order, that one doth ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and ſucceſſively diſcover another, God in his wiſdome providing for the neceſſity and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of unworthie mankind, making one thing to be a Key unto another, and each ſubordinate diſcovery a help unto a higher.</p>
               <p>Now that all things in the World are made for the ſake and uſe of man, is confirmed by ſeveral places of Scripture, and appeares by experience, each day affording Teſtimonies of the ſame.</p>
               <p>From Hunger man is ſecured by a plentifull
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51297:37"/>proviſion of food, both meat and drink, from cold by cloths and fire, from diſeaſes by medicines.</p>
               <p>Nor hath God adjourned the cure of the ſick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the time of the attainment of the higheſt <hi>Arcana,</hi> ſince very few there are in an Age, that have this skill (although I beleeve it to be chiefly the fault of our neglect, that ſo few do know, what Legacies out <hi>Heavenly Father</hi> hath left us in the Creatures) for in <hi>ſimple Concretes</hi> may be found the perfect Cure of moſt (not to ſay all) diſeaſes, were we but as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, as we ought in the inquirie and ſearch after them.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the number of Herbs is almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite (as to our knowledge) the virtues of them known to very few, and thoſe which are known, are more preciſe in operation, and efficacie, ſo that, a practiſe upon <hi>ſimples</hi> would be very tedious, and difficult, therfore there are ſome <hi>ſimples</hi> that with an caſie preparation work admirable effects (as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one <hi>Salt,</hi> to Wit, <hi>Nitre,</hi> by which ſlightly prepared how many diſeaſes may be cured, and by its <hi>Spirit</hi> many more, and more difficult.</p>
               <p>For verily, although many <hi>Concretes</hi> are, as nature hath formed them of ſingular virtue, yet the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of practiſing by them, may appear by inſtance. As ſuppoſe a man who is troubled with <hi>Nephritical</hi> pains, would be cured, or at leaſt eaſed, by ſuch a way of practiſe, for ſeveral intentions, ſeveral Herbs are gathered, as <hi>Virga Aurea, Becapunga, Althaea, Malva Sem. Dauci, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe by infuſion are compoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a drink, and by it eaſe is found, yet if a Phiſician ſhould have many ſuch Patients, they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a large ſtock of theſe <hi>ſimples,</hi> which if gathered out of ſeaſon, are of little or no virtue, and therfore muſt be provided in due time, and becauſe theſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51297:37"/>diſeaſes will not be confined to ſuch ſeaſons of the year, in which theſe herbs are in their greateſt vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they muſt be therefore gathered ſeaſonably, dried carefully, and kept ſafely, elſe their virtue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſe, may be either notably impaired or quite loſt, now to have ſufficient quantitie of all herbs which are commended for all the ſorts of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to which mans frail Bodie is ſubject, ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gathered, carefully dried, and ſafely kept, is a task (I fear) too ſhamefully neglected by the Doctours of our Age, who commit all this Care to the Apothecaries, in which they are ſo ſupinely negligent, that it is a ſhame to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
               <p>But beſides this trouble, herbs, or ſeeds, or flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or roots, though never ſo ſeaſonably gathered, or maturely dried, or carefully kept, yet in ſhort time are liable to a ſpontaneous loſs of Virtue, which is (when gone) irrepatable, which inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to remedie, many inventions are uſed, but to very little purpoſe.</p>
               <p>However the Medicinal <hi>apparatus</hi> for ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is ſo great, that a man may at eaſier rates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a Ship of great Burden from Port to Port, then tranſplant a well furniſhed Apothecaries Shop, from Town to Town, ſo that all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that is left, a Phiſician in this Caſe, (unleſs he will be ſo tied to a place, as not to be able to leave it) is to expect Apothecaries furniſhed wherever he goes, and for his own part, to attend onely the Gooſquill practiſe, (which is the Trade of all our modern Doctors) by which way he may as confidently aſſure himſelf, or his befool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Patients of good ſucceſs, as that Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank could, who copying out thouſands of Receits,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51297:38"/>for ſeveral diſtempers, of which he knew not one, put his patients to draw each one his Chance, at adventure, out of a Bag, with this ſhort praier, God ſend thee good luck.</p>
               <p>Moreover who ſees not, that notwithſtanding the large proviſion, God hath made for the cure of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by the means of ſimple Medicaments, that ſcarce a certain cure of one maladie in ten, hath yet been found out, in the common way of practiſe, and If I ſhould ſay, not one in ſo many, I ſhould do them no wrong.</p>
               <p>Therefore hath the neceſſity of mankind put men upon the ſearch of a more accurate preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Simples</hi> to the end, that Nature being help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Art, through her Adminiſtration, and its Cooperation. Medicaments may be prepared, which may effect that which before was ſought for, in ſeveral <hi>Simples,</hi> and without ſucceſs, becauſe of either ignorance of their abſolute Virtue, or negligence in their gathering, or keeping, or indiſcretion in their Application, or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
               <p>Now this is done many waies, and according to the ſeveral waies of handling of them, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines may be made of various Virtues, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie.</p>
               <p>Bare decoction, which is the height of the <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicalaribes Therapeucie,</hi> is a ſlovenly, ignorant, biun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering dotage, the unſufficiency of which kind of preparation of Vegetables, ſundrie ſucceſſive Ages have reſtified, and many ſick people to the loſs of both their expectation and monies, and not rarely of their lives, have experimented.</p>
               <p>Which inſufficiencie, ſeveral ſtudious Sons of Art obſerving, have with all poſſible diligence, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51297:38"/>the preparation of <hi>Simples,</hi> and this for the taking away of their ſuperfluous <hi>faeces,</hi> the matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their <hi>Crudities,</hi> the extinction of their viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and malignitie, and advancing of the hidden Spirit which is <hi>aethereal</hi> to its tranſcendent degree of putitie.</p>
               <p>To theſe, in teſtimony of their being ſent from God for the pulling down of the old ruinous way of the blind Philoſophie of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> were given certain <hi>Diplomata,</hi> or Evidences of their miſſion, by the miraculous Teſtimony of powerful <hi>Arcanas,</hi> commanding credit in their Doctrine, ſo new (as to repute) and ſo <hi>Diametrically</hi> oppoſed to the good old way, (ſo ſtiled and beleeved) of the Ancients, which without ſuch commanding Arguments, would never loſe the repute they had by long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription gained in the World.</p>
               <p>By this means, the Ingenuous ſort being awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all of them ſeeing their own Nakedneſſe, ſome triflingly ſought only for <hi>ſgleaves</hi> to hide the ſame, others being convinced thoroughly of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie of Vulgar Medicines, ſeriouſly inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after a more ſecure way.</p>
               <p>And reading of the rare, and almoſt miraculous Virtue of ſome Choice ſecrets, which ſo highly adorned, and for that cauſe were ſo highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Antiſtites</hi> or <hi>Champions</hi> of this diſcoverie, their minds were wholly inſlamed with the deſire, of them, rejecting, and neglecting all other things below theſe Top Secrets, as being unworthie their ſearch.</p>
               <p>To theſe, my preſent peroration, concerning this foredeſcribed Subject, is intended, to vvhom I ſhall addreſs my ſelf in this ſort.</p>
               <p>That you are convinced of the inſufficiency of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51297:39"/>the vulgar method, I am glad for your ſakes, I alſo am of your mind and opinion, and can convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfie my ſelf and the world, of the Truth of the ſame, as in the firſt Apologetical Treatiſe I have in part done.</p>
               <p>That you alſo are deſirous of the moſt noble me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, I commend, only adviſe, that this devotion of yours be managed by diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But that you ſhould wave all practice upon, or diſquiſition after inferiour Medicaments, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſecute the Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt,</hi> the <hi>Horizontal Gold, &amp;c.</hi> it is ſo high an injurie to diſcretion, as if a man who is convinced of the realitie of the Philoſophical Tinging Elixtrs, Red and White, ſhould reject all means of lively-hood, unleſs he might attain this matchleſs way of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Should a man never attempt a draught of <hi>Painting</hi> unleſs he were certainly able to mend <hi>Apelles</hi> his draught of <hi>Venus,</hi> it is unlikely he ſhould ever be a good <hi>Limner:</hi> or ſhould a man refuſe all emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> unleſs he could attain to the <hi>Supremacy?</hi> He might and certainly would ſpend all his life unprofitably, or ſhould one abſolutely reſolve againſt all deeds of <hi>Charity,</hi> till he were able to releeval the poor round about him he would be accounted (and worthily) a raſh reſolved man, yet not unlike to him, who adjourns his practice in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, till he may equal <hi>Helmont</hi> or <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in medicines.</p>
               <p>For ſuch a man is unerateful to God, injurious to himſelf, and unrighteous to his neighbour, and with his own hands doth what in him lies to ruine the foundation of his future hopes and expectation.</p>
               <p>If God hath given thee (O man whoever thou
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51297:39"/>art) one Talent; and thou ſhalt reſolve to burie it becauſe but one, how canſt thou hope to evade the doom and deſtinie of the unfaithful ſervant; for this very ſloathfulneſs, made an example to all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p>The gifts of God are not our own to imploy at our pleaſure, but are to be uſed for his Glorie, and the good both of our ſelves, and ſuch among whom we converſe, and in ſo doing we ſhall both reap comfort, and may expect an en bettering of our Talents and Guifts, but otherwiſe if laid aſide in deſpondencie, becauſe they are not ſuch as pleaſe and like us, they ruſt, that is, grow worſe for want of uſing, and decreaſe for want of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving.</p>
               <p>For I look upon a man, that is ingaged in theſe diſcoveries of <hi>Nature,</hi> like to a Traveller in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, whom every ſhort ſtep advanceth forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his journies end, who if he ſhould forbear to ſtep a ſtep, becauſe a ſtep is but ſhort, and makes him little the neerer to the End propoſed, he will never reach the place appointed, and to reſolve to ſtay in one place, till he may with one jump accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his deſire, is both fooliſh to imagine, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to perform.</p>
               <p>Iuſt ſo is it in this Caſe, the Adept Magical skill, or knowledge, is a long way at a diſtance from a young Beginner or <hi>Tyro,</hi> yet is the whole interval filled with varietie of Rarities, of admirable Virtue, and ſtill higher and higher in excellencie, by how much neerer they approach to the perfection of <hi>Nature,</hi> which <hi>Art</hi> can attein to, theſe intervening ſecrets are (as it were) ſo many ſteps <hi>on ward</hi> in the <hi>journie</hi> toward <hi>perfection,</hi> &amp; do lead to it, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> neglected, it is very rare that any arrive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51297:40"/>the higheſt, unleſs ſome <hi>Chemieal</hi> Angel by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a Maſter by information, do that for the Artiſt vvhich the <hi>Angel</hi> did by <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> vvhen he brought him, vvithout ſtepping one ſtep by the hair of the head, out of <hi>Iudea</hi> into <hi>Babylon</hi> to releeve ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptived <hi>Daniel,</hi> vvhich is not an ordinary accident.</p>
               <p>The troden beaten path, is by imploying vvhat Talents God beſtovvs on us, to expect an increaſe of the ſame, for firſt of all, the <hi>Analogy</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen Gods Creatures, is ſuch, that by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of ſome in their <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Operations,</hi> vvhich are more viſible, &amp; vvith leſs difficulty attained, vve learn to order and to examine, to vvork upon, and prepare other things, that are more ſecret, although not in fallibly, as to any particular receipt, yet not uncertainly, as to the <hi>Philoſophical Doctrine,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, vvhich vve receive thereby.</p>
               <p>Adde to this that the hidden ſpirit vvhich is in all things, is in ſome more, and in ſome leſs noble, and efficacious, and ſo proportionably is in ſome more at liberty, in other things more ſtreightly ſhut up, and ſealed, and among <hi>Concretes</hi> of the 3 diſtinct Kingdomes, <hi>Animal, Vegetable,</hi> and <hi>Mineral</hi> may be found, and is to be ſeen ſuch an agreeableneſs in <hi>nature</hi> that one is as it vvere the Key unto the other, by vvhich it may be opened, and both together (through the povver of a ſupervening <hi>ſerment</hi>) may be graduated to a virtue far more noble, then vvas in them before,</p>
               <p>But more over vve are to be remembred, (vvhich elſe vve ſhall feel vvith a Witneſs) that this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie of <hi>nature</hi> is not carried on vvithout charge, &amp; expence, when a man ſhal beſides his neceſſary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of meat and drink, be neceſſitated to provide a houſe convenient for his intent, and in it, to build
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51297:40"/>ſurnaces, provide ſeveral ſorts of <hi>inſtruments,</hi> beſides coals, glaſſes, ſervants vvages, and all Materials, vvhich charge if it produce nothing that vvill defray it ſelf, It makes the Philoſopher onely a fit ſubject for a Balladmonger, to be ſung to the tune of, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune my Foe, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such incouragement vvill ſoon make a man vveary of his Philoſophie, being to himſelf onely a ſubject of diſcontent, and to others, eſpecially his Kindred an object of reproach and deriſion, vvhich are but very bad means to incite a man to a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute progreſs or to vvhet his ingeny, for a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute finding out the things ſought for, and deſired.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore in brief give the tvvo chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of a vviſe and diſereet, and of a fooliſh and prepoſterous ſearcher after the myſteries of nature, to the end, that being thus perſonated, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, the Reader may the better judge of each of them, and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Such a one is generally credulous, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore ſeldome but deceived, he is ſome way or other convinced of the inſufficiencie of Vulgar Medicine, both in the method, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments of it, and by ſome fortune or other, he falls upon ſome Treatiſe that ſpeaks of a more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual way of practiſe, or meets with ſome Artiſt or other, from whom either by <hi>Argument,</hi> or <hi>ocular proof</hi> he gets Conviction of the Realitie of <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Medicines.</hi>

               <p>He is for the moſt part garrulous, and vainly glorious, and in defiance of whatever is beneath his own hopes, is oft declaiming of his <hi>Art,</hi> where of he hath alreadie promiſed himſelf the true at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; and therefore reſpects himſelf as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, though of little experience, yet of infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,</p>

               <p>With conſideration of vvhat he vvill do hereafter, he is abundantly ſatisfied and vvholly taken up, &amp; for this end he is ſeldom unfurniſhed of a device or tvvo in his head, that may bring to paſs, and effect al this, and a great deal more, vvhich my intended bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie vvill not give me leave to particularize.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore come, and it is time) to take a ſurvey of him in his operations, his receits (becauſe devoted unto everlaſting ſecrecie) I ſhall not teach, though I might, as knovving not a fevv of the means, by vvhich a thouſand rare intentions are, or have been deſigned to be brought about.</p>
               <p>If it be the ſtone, that our <hi>Philoſopher</hi> longs for, he hath firſt of all, the thing ſo exquiſitely pourtraied in <hi>Idaea,</hi> that a more curious <hi>Dramma</hi> cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, vvhat it muſt be, of vvhat form, and hovv to be uſed to any of his intentional devices.</p>
               <p>Then he falls foul upon his <hi>matter,</hi> in vvhich for the moſt part he begs his queſtion, namely, <hi>That ſuch a thing, by ſuch operations, will be the reſult of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo prepared,</hi> on vvhich he falls furiouſly to <hi>practiſe,</hi> ſtil expecting or hoping for his propounded deſires</p>

               <p>Now becauſe that he aimes at nothing inferiout to the perfect maſterie, and preſumes himſelf Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſame, he contemns any thing inferiour to the higheſt attainments, and ſo although Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine generally be his pretence, yet with this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> that when ſuch Medicines, which he ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By which means he is profeſſedly ignorant of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, but what is his ultimate End propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and of that he cannot but be really igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant enough, having no knowledge of it, but what an ignorant imagination hath framed unto him. For what ever a man knowes not, he may vvell be adjudged ignorant of, vvhich may eaſily be underſtood by any, and can be denied by none, novv vvhat an <hi>Idea,</hi> any man in likelihood, can make to himſelf, of a thing he never ſavv nor vvas ever inſtructed in, but by various books, the Authors of many of vvhich never ſavv vvhat they deſctibed, nor knevv vvhat they treat of, in vvhich number many vvhoſe books are extant may be reckoned, I ſhall leave to the Conſideration of the <hi>Indifferent Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this means he verifies the Proverb of him, vvho <hi>reaching at a ſtar stumbles at a ſtraw,</hi> reſolving to appear nothing, unleſs he may equal the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, he lives all his life in obſcuritie, care, and anxietie.</p>
               <p>Although vvhile his hopes are in their bloſſome he is no ſmall Philoſopher in his ovvn imagination,

               <p>For ſo long as he can defray the charge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, he vvill never be out of practice, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome out of Courage, but looking onely for the <hi>Stone of the Wiſe,</hi> or the <hi>Immortal diſſolver</hi> of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> if his Operations miſs this mark, he judgeth them onely fit for the <hi>Dung-hill</hi> and ſo addreſſeth himſelf to another, (perhaps to another kind of) operation.</p>
               <p>Thus is he daily impoveriſhed, by expence of Coals, and Inſtruments of Glaſs, Earth, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Charge of the Materials he uſeth, beſides Labourers Wages, and various Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces daily made and altered, vvhich vvill ſoon ſink a fair eſtate.</p>

               <p>But vvhen a man ſhall account himſelf <hi>Craeſus</hi> in effect, hovv far this mad dotage doth ſtir him, vvho beleeves it to exceed his former allovvance in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary expence, fevv that have knovvn any of theſe Philoſophers (and vvho is it that hath not knovvn ſome?) but can ſatisfie themſelves, and then beſides

               <p>Such a one is from his childhood given to ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, &amp; from the firſt of his yeers of <hi>maturity,</hi> his <hi>mind</hi> is buſie, and his <hi>thoughts</hi> penſive, hovv he may live ſerviceable to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>mankind,</hi> according to the <hi>Talents,</hi> vvith vvhich he is intruſted from above.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Temporal preferments</hi> are the leaſt of his thoughts, as being dangerous <hi>baits,</hi> both for ſoul and bodie hazarding oftentimes both: The <hi>Gentlemans</hi> life of <hi>pleaſure</hi> is to him a <hi>burthen</hi> to think of: the <hi>Lawyers Art</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> is to him a <hi>purgatorie</hi> to embrace: &amp; to live an <hi>idle Speculator,</hi> both odious and itkeſome.</p>
               <p>He knovvs that this <hi>life</hi> is but a <hi>race,</hi> in vvhich vve ought (as to a <hi>Gole</hi>) to run to <hi>Eternity,</hi> and therfore the higheſt emploiment, he eſteems, is to glorifie God himſelf, and exhort others to do the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:51297:44"/>
               <p>But becauſe he is rare to be found, who is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for theſe things, he is ſenſible of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie, and dares not meddle therein further then concerns his own ſalvation, and being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to partake in other mens ſins, and yet abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved, by no means to live out of emploiment; he therfore (next to the glorie of God, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs in advancing pietie in himſelf and others) accounts Medicine to be the moſt deſirable, and higheſt attainment.</p>
               <p>And truly, he that wil ſeriouſly and ſoberly weigh and ponder matters as he ought, cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the ſame upon undeniable grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for who is he who cannot experimentally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with him who adviſed to pray, <hi>Vt ſit mens ſana in corpore ſano?</hi> it being evident, that while we inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit theſe <hi>Cottages</hi> of <hi>Clay,</hi> bodily infirmities are (next unto ſins) the diſturbers of the <hi>mind,</hi> diſabling the <hi>ſoul</hi> in all her <hi>functions,</hi> and rendring our <hi>life</hi> more burthenſome than <hi>death,</hi> by reaſon of which many (with <hi>Iob</hi>) wiſh for death but cannot find it, that in the grave they might ceaſe from all worldly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, miſeries and infirmities.</p>
               <p>Which though moſt juſtly and righteouſly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for our ſins, were yet the object of <hi>Chriſts mercy</hi> and <hi>compaſsion,</hi> who went about <hi>doing good</hi> and <hi>curing</hi> all manner of <hi>diſeaſes</hi> among the people, and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> who after <hi>Chriſt</hi> were to <hi>publish the Goſpel through all the World,</hi> they through the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> confirmed the ſame by <hi>Miracles,</hi> not to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and ſubduing of Kingdomes, but the Cure of <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>Maladies:</hi> in imitation of whom this Son of Art is carneſt at the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and ſedulous as to the ſearch after <hi>Natures ſecrets</hi> in the <hi>fire,</hi> that he may (through the bleſſing of the

               <p>For this end, he takes advice of thoſe, who went before him, according to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> rule, <hi>Proving all things, but holding faſt onely what is good;</hi> on which ſcore, he conſults <hi>Galen, Hippocrates, Avicen, Rhafis Meſue, Fernelius, Sennertus, &amp;c.</hi> all, to wit, both <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>modern,</hi> and this with a ſincere aim and intent to better his judgement, and ripen his skill in order to a medicinal practice.</p>
               <p>He doth not (as many do) for company ſake, rail at, &amp; crie down the old way, received in the <hi>Schools;</hi> but makes trial of it according to the Scholaſtick promiſes, to bring about (with ſincere intentions) his patients expectations.</p>
               <p>But alas! upon proof, he finds the whole <hi>Art,</hi> as it is <hi>Academically</hi> taught, to be but an Embleme of that <hi>Stable</hi> which was cleanſed by <hi>Hercules,</hi> a <hi>miſcellaneous Hotchpotch,</hi> partly falſe, partly ridiculous, generally deſperate and dangerous.</p>
               <p>I grant indeed, that <hi>Nature</hi> hath produced almoſt infinite <hi>Simples</hi> of rare and excellent virtues, which with duc preparation and application, would cure moſt (if not all) diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Yet conſidering the determinateneſs of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in which they grow &amp; are in their virtue, their reſtriction to this or that particular ſoil, according to the <hi>Proverb, non omnis ſert omnia tellus,</hi> their preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs required, and curioſitie in gathering, drying, and keeping, the obſervance neceſſarie in their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for, and application to diſeaſed perſons, and laſtly their ſingularitie in operation, being each of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51297:45"/>one ſufficient for any caſe, in theſe conſiderations it muſt be granted that he who would deſerve the name of a Phyſician, muſt have a larger knowledge then that of <hi>Simples,</hi> leſt he oft be accuſed by his practice, of a lame and inſufficient Method of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
               <p>Add to this, the new <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> which daily appeareth on the Stage, and many of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted by our Methodiſts incurable, and ſo added to a large ſcroll of the ſame ſort, which hath long ſince been compiled by them, and all becauſe they wanted diſtinguiſhing medicines, with which a Son of Art is ſtored, as evidences of his being created by and ſent from God, and not the Schools.</p>
               <p>Conſidering which, a true Son of Art, finding the inſufficiencie of the vulgarly profeſſed method of medicine, doth addreſs himſelf to other means and waies of furniſhing himſelf with ſuch medicaments which God hath made for the <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>behoof</hi> of man.</p>
               <p>And hearing of <hi>Medicaments,</hi> commended by <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Art</hi> (ſuch who were curious to ſearch and ſtudie <hi>Nature,</hi> for finding out of the ſame, for their virtue, and efficacie againſt ſuch <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> which to the old <hi>Methodiſts</hi> appear, &amp; by them are confeſſed <hi>incurable;</hi> He thereupon ingageth himſelf in the <hi>ſearch</hi> of the ſame, eſpecially beſides their <hi>verbal teſtimony,</hi> having on one hand the evidence of Reaſon, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, the unanſwerable conviction of proof, &amp; Experiment to confirm the ſame unto him.</p>
               <p>What concerns <hi>proof</hi> and <hi>experiment,</hi> the Cures of <hi>Paracelſus: Quercetan: Suchten,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> and before them of <hi>Baſilius Valentinus, &amp;c.</hi> are beyondal denial and queſtion, and although that might be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent conviction, to a man rational, yet moreover,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51297:45"/>there is ſo cleer a light of Reaſon, for the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Pyrotechnical way</hi> of <hi>Medicine,</hi> as doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently convince the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> and inables them to ſtop the mouth of Gainſayers.</p>
               <p>Of this I have ſpoken largely enough, in my firſt <hi>Chapters</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> nor do I, nor ſhould Loring the ſame in again, but that I intend this <hi>Chapter,</hi> as a ſhort Compriſal of what I wrote before.</p>
               <p>To proceed therefore, a true Searcher of Nature having by <hi>practical obſervation</hi> proved the inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of the Old (though vulgarly adored) way of Medicine, reſolves (with Gods aſſiſtance) to ſpare no <hi>labor,</hi> nor <hi>ſtudie,</hi> nor <hi>expence,</hi> in purſuance of ſuch <hi>Secrets,</hi> which (by <hi>Reaſon</hi> he is convinced, and by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of <hi>Artiſts</hi> he is confirmed) are in <hi>Nature,</hi> for the enabling of him, who is poſſeſſor of them, unto the help of ſuch, to whom it ſhall pleaſe God, they be adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>On theſe grounds he goes on, with a mind reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and fixed, not wavering nor inconſtant to his principles, but with reſolution proſecuting his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts when once undertaken.</p>
               <p>And becauſe he goes about the diſcovery of <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>hidden myſteries,</hi> he provides himſelf according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſolved not to be diſcouraged, though he hap to miſs again and again, nor to give over his <hi>ſearch,</hi> although for a long time, he fall ſhort of his deſired expectation.</p>
               <p>He acknowledgeth and admireth the <hi>greater Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,,</hi> and could if God ſaw it good wiſh himſelf a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of the <hi>higheſtmedicines,</hi> yet contemneth he not, the <hi>leaſt knowledge</hi> that is <hi>true,</hi> ſo that, w<hi rend="sub">t</hi> whatſoever it is is poſſible for him to do the <hi>leaſt real good,</hi> he doth it.</p>
               <p>He aſcribeth the glorie of his <hi>knowledge</hi> unto God, from whom acknowledging its receipt, he dare
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51297:46"/>not bury any <hi>Talent,</hi> but imploies each improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God grants him upon his labours, to do more and more good each day then other, and thus with the help and aſſiſtance of the <hi>Almightie,</hi> he increaſeth knowledge day by day.</p>
               <p>And ſeriouſly when I contemplate the <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>Natures Arcana</hi>'s, I adore therein, the wiſdome of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> who in them ſeems to point out the <hi>Method</hi> of a mans <hi>studie,</hi> which an <hi>Artiſt</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miſs, if he Conſider firſt, his Neighbours neceſſitie, and ſecondly, his own conveniencie, to both which in wiſedome, God hath ſuited nature moſt exactly.</p>
               <p>The neceſſitie of our Neighbour may inſtruct us, if we conſider the variety of diſeaſes, to which poor man is ſubject, not all of them, of alike diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie to cure, and yet, the leaſt difficult to cure are as truculent, as any, if not helped by Art.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in a few caſes, firſt the <hi>Fever,</hi> how general each yeer is it among, and how afflictive, yea dangerous and mortal to mankind, and yet certainly to be helped by many preparations, eaſily made, at any place, at any (and in a ſhort) time, of which kind are our <hi>Agues,</hi> by us ſo called, but all known to the <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> under one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</p>
               <p>Tis true, that the <hi>Greater Arcanas</hi> do cure all theſe diſeaſes with all other, both <hi>acute</hi> and <hi>chronical</hi>) in a ſhort time, ſeldome exceeding, in any <hi>fever</hi> (except onely the <hi>Hectick;</hi> which is a real <hi>Tabes</hi>) above one <hi>doſe,</hi> of theſe <hi>Arcana</hi>'s there are many, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable of Virtue, but rarely given to any <hi>Artiſt,</hi> yet in defect of theſe, there are many <hi>febrifuges,</hi> on which a careful Phiſician may confide, and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51297:46"/>his credit, not will they ever blemiſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſuch as uſe them.</p>
               <p>Theſe particular ſuccedaneous medicines, are the Crown uſually of the endeavors of many, to whom the greater ſecrets are (in Gods wiſdome for a time) denied: nor are theſe ſecrets ſo rare in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo difficult in preparation, nor require ſo long time, being deſtined, as it were by God, to be eaſily and quickly provided, for the remedie of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes which will accept of no truce, of which ſort, I could tell many, but that I reſerve that diſcoverie to another more proper place.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, many other diſeaſes are cured by caſie medicines, which (if not mortal are yet) burthenſome to the partie afflicted, rendring the life uncomfortable, as the <hi>Scorbute, Hyſterical fits.</hi> the <hi>Iaundiſe, Convulſions, Cholical fits, Nephritical pains. &amp;c.</hi> Which by Gods bleſſings are, have been, and may be certainly cured, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Medicines, ſuccedancous to the great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and thoſe very Diſeaſes, which are ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daring to Phiſicians, as the <hi>Gout,</hi> the <hi>Epilepſie, &amp;c.</hi> have their <hi>mitiora Symptomata,,</hi> which are eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by particular Remedies.</p>
               <p>Which things conſidered, it is a madneſs unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, for any one vvho ſhall engage himſelf in theſe Diſcoveries, to reſolve againſt all medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal practice, till he may be <hi>Majorum Arcanorum Adeptus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſince there are ſo many Diſeaſes, ſo afflictive, nay ſo truculent, the Cure of which needs not the <hi>Greater Arcana,</hi> how cruel is he to mankind, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to God, and injurious to Nature, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſtudie Nature, ſhall neglect the ſearch

               <p>I know it will be objected againſt me out of <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> who in his 9. <hi>Cap. de Lithiaſi</hi> writes thus, <hi>Nemo ſanaverit Lepram qui Liquore Alchahefl non ſit potitus, &amp;c.</hi> to which I cannot anſwer experimentally, as never having had a <hi>Leper</hi> for my patient, yet with all reſpect to that <hi>great Philoſopher,</hi> I muſt crave leav, to be of another mind, nor is my diverſitie in opinion, grounded without a Collateral experiment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm me, of which, I ſhall take time elſewhere to ſpeak more largely.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this <hi>Chapter</hi> ſpeedily, having a little touched at the Artiſts convenience, which (I ſaid before) was to be as it were his <hi>line</hi> and <hi>plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> in his ſearches, together with his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours neceſſitie, of which I have alreadie ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>In which place, it is not unſeaſonable to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what, and what manner of men they are who uſually betake themſelves ſeriouſly to the ſtudie of <hi>Ingenious Arts,</hi> they are at the beſt <hi>mediocris,</hi> for the moſt part <hi>nullius fortunae homines,</hi> thoſe of large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the mean time minding pleaſure and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by which means their lives are ſhortned, their health impaired, and themſelves become objects at
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51297:47"/>laſt of pittie (as to their health) to ſuch, whom God makes heirs of Medicinal Science.</p>
               <p>So that according to the <hi>Proverb, Soli Philoſophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur pauperes,</hi> which is a true <hi>Proverb</hi> ſuiting with our wretched Age, Philoſophie formerly being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an entertainment for a Prince, and ſuch who were Philoſophers being reputed the companions, only fit for Monarchs and great Perſonages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now, the Art muſt take its fare, being admired on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the meaner (at the beſt) of the middle ſort of men (as to fortune) and thoſe for their pains, by the Vulgar reputed mad, and deſerving to live in want, and diſeſteem, for addicting themſelves to ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh a Science.</p>
               <p>Of ſuch Sons it is had in eſteem, yet according to the <hi>Poet, Virtus laudatur &amp; alget,</hi> theſe favourites of Philoſophie, although they love her never ſo well, yet they cannot dreſs her out in that dreſs, which ſhe deſerves, to make her ſeem beautiful.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that whoever he is that courts <hi>Nature,</hi> he had need court her for an inheritance to have with her a Competencie, by which he may both live comfortably, and continue in her ſervice without diſtraction.</p>
               <p>For this end, he is willing to be at reaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, until he may come a little into her inner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, expecting then from her a penſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his ſervice, by which he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to continue the ſame, and not be compelled to court another Miſtriſs for a lively-hood, whether war, or Courtſhip or the like.</p>
               <p>And this indeed is the Courteſie of that <hi>Nymph,</hi> that ſhe ſuffers none of her ſervants to be long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded, but doth according to the time, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their ſervice, alot unto each a reward,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51297:48"/>by vvhich he may both comfortably ſubſiſt, and carefully goe on, in his future Search, and ſtudie.</p>
               <p>But to be maſter of her greateſt ſecrets, is the Crown that few attain, and thoſe only ſuch, who by an eſpecial grace are elected thereto.</p>
               <p>Now for any one to reſolve that unleſs he may be the commander and diſpoſer of Natures moſt rare, and feldome beſtowed ſecrets, he will refuſe ſuch as are offred him, it is ſo high an indiſcretion, as cannot be pleaded for.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as the ſearch into Nature, and her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets is not to be performed without coſt and charge, which, ſo ſoon as a man is maſter of any (though inferiour) ſecret, that vvill defray; for him to refuſe this, becauſe it is not the top ſecret of Art and Nature, is no leſs madneſs, then for a man to refolve to go naked, till he is able to go clad in the richeſt Sattin.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as are ſober Sons of Nature, they knovv and are ſenſible that each diſcoverie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires coſt and charge, to bring it about, and therefore vveighing the neceſſities of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they are ſenſible, that many ſecrets of Nature of an inferiour, and ſome of a middle rank to the higheſt are very noble, and efficacious, and ſo not to be ſleighted, vvithout incurring the cenſure of folly and madneſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore he accepts of God thankfully, as pledges of future bleſſings to be beſtovved, or as <hi>Io shuah</hi> received the <hi>Bunch</hi> of <hi>Grapes,</hi> as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the <hi>Promiſed Land,</hi> or as a Metalliſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts a Marchaſite, as an Index of a Mine, not far from diſcoverie, many of vvhich pledges, a careful Son of Art ſhall meet vvith in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51297:48"/>vvhich improved as they ought, vvill bring glorie to God the Giver, comfort to the Patient that makes uſe of them, and ſupport and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the Phyſician the Poſſeſſour of them, by experience of vvhich he is incouraged, and by the profit and benefit, enabled to go on vvith more and more courage, untill by induſtrie and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Almightie, he by degrees ſhall diſcover greater and greater Secrets, till at the laſt, he arrive to the higheſt pitch, namely the greateſt Secrets of all.</p>
               <p>Some perhaps vvho vvill ſeek means to Carp, and to object, may caſt in my Diſh, vvhat I in my firſt part (vvhich vvas Apologetical) vvrote, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that in nature there vvere ſo many Secrets Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criferous, that a man ſhould not be compelled, to practice Phiſick for neceſſitie of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>This Objection I might have let alone, till I had met vvith it, but (if poſſible) to remove all viſible, and ſeeming Grounds from Cavilling ſpirits, I ſhall here anticipate it.</p>
               <p>T'is very true, that Nature is rich and abundantly ſtored vvith varietie of choice ſecrets, and thoſe very lueriferous, ſo bountiful a Ladie ſhe is, that none ever yet courted her ſerionſly, and conſtantly in vain.</p>
               <p>But yet her vvaies by vvhich ſhe revvards her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are good to be conſidered, for ſhe doth not uſually requite their pains and diligence vvith coined monie, (as ſome great perſonages being in danger of their lives, to divert their follovvers have throvvn <hi>Checkeens</hi> and <hi>Piſtolets</hi> among them) No verily, her revvard conſiſts in ſecrets, vvhich are of uſe and benefit to thoſe, by vvhom they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51297:49"/>made uſe of, and upon that ſcore, lucriferous to the Maſter and Poſſeſſour of them.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Secrets are of various kinds, which the ſtudious ſearcher of Nature (unleſs ſtrangely led by an unfortunate deſtinie) cannot but meet withall, at the leaſt one or other of them, of which ſort I might mention many, but that it is needleſs in this place, by this Art the Bow Die was found out, by this Art the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Yellow Pearles, and coloured Diamonds, hath been found out by others, beſides many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular gradations and mineral extractions, known to many, and the product real, true, and not ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate mettals.</p>
               <p>But the Cure of the Sick is an Emploiment, that engageth the Conſciences of all ſuch, to whom God hath given abilities, as being of a more excellent Nature, yea a Work of Mercie, not misbecoming the hands of a Prince, as God experimentally (for a long time taught our Kings, in the Cure of that Diſeaſe; common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, and called by the name of the Kings Evil.</p>
               <p>But if muſt be granted, nor can it be denied, that he who ſhall devote himſelf to theſe ſtudies, muſt have a Competent Maintenance, elſe no wiſe man would, or could excuſe his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie of Follie, which maintenance although he might have ſeveral waies, he onely admires the goodneſs of God, who ſo many waies, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in Nature for ſuch as are ſtudious, as they ought, but (as every wiſe man is known by his choice, where he hath libertie of various choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) makes that his means of ſupport, by which he may doe moſt good, and lead a life
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51297:49"/>moſt beneficial to many, ſuch is the life of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Art of Medicine, and ſo is the objection anſwered.</p>
               <p>So then, it is not out of neceſſitie of a lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that a Son of Art is compelled to practice Medicine, for he having other waies at command may make uſe of any, although (out of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) he makes choice of that among many, by which he may do moſt good, and therefore attends the Practice of Medicine, and attending it, he Conſcionably expects, and honeſtly reaps a living from it.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>The firſt Chapter, being an Introductorie Hiſtorical Narration of my firſt Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, and firſt Progreſs in</hi> Chemical Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</head>
               <p>IN the year of Our Lord 1644. I firſt began the ſtudie of <hi>Chemical Philoſophie,</hi> to which how I came firſt to be incited would be a diſcourſe in this place, both tedious and uſeleſs, onely this I muſt ſay and acknowledge, that ſo good grounds invited me, and ſo good incouragement confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that from that time, to this preſent year 1658. I never repented my time beſtowed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the pains, I have ſince taken therein, were irkeſome to undergoe, and would be tedious to recite.</p>
               <p>My aim and intentions at my firſt entrance, might poſſibly be of the ſame Kind with others, whom curioſitie or other incitements allure to the Art, however my progreſs was ſuch (as to point of induſtrie and diligence) as might become a devoted Son to <hi>Hermes,</hi> and my aimes (as to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51297:50"/>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) onely <hi>Medicine,</hi> or at leaſt that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally.</p>
               <p>I had not proceeded far, nor gone on long in theſe <hi>Studies,</hi> before I had gotten a reaſonable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Authors,</hi> who treat of this learning, whom I firſt began to read, then to admire, and laſtly to deſire to imitate.</p>
               <p>This way of Learning, found the eaſier enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and readier acceptance with me, as one who was in affection diſingaged, from the <hi>School Philoſophie,</hi> as requiring a ſenſeleſſe faith to beleeve it, being indeed at the beſt, but rotten.</p>
               <p>This (though but a Youth) I perceived eaſily (as I more largely told you in my firſt <hi>Apologetical part,</hi> as alſo in my <hi>Treatiſe</hi> which I wrote <hi>De Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quore Alchaheſt</hi> in <hi>Latine</hi>) and on that account, I valued the time I ſpent in the attainment of that <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> but loſt, and on that ſcore, I readily embraced that <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> which gave its Sons, and Students better hopes.</p>
               <p>This kind of <hi>Philoſophie</hi> I accounted ſuch, and therefore devoted my ſelf wholly to it, yet ſo, that the neceſſitie of attending Academical Studies, for fear of giving offence to my friends and Tutours, compelled me to beſtow a great deal of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, in learning that <hi>Philoſophie</hi> which Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially I Contemned, being convinced of its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitie.</p>
               <p>And having (on ſerious and ſober grounds) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved the Studie and imploiment of Medicine. I firſt aſſaied <hi>Galen, Fernelius,</hi> and <hi>Sennertus,</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to ſee what I could find in them, and then to theſe I added the <hi>Chemical</hi> Writers, hoping by the <hi>Theorie</hi> of the one, and the practice of the other,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51297:51"/>to find a ſecure way of curing diſeaſes. And to deal ingeniouſly) opportunitie of practice, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it ſelf each day, gave me opportunitie to find the promiſes of many proved vain, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the moſt abſolute conviction of all, though curſed by the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>—Careat ſucceſsibus opto</l>
                     <l>Quiſquis ab eventu, facta notanda putet.</l>
                  </q> This daily diſappointment made me to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other Writers and Authours, and at laſt, I got all, or at leaſt the moſt eminent, whom I ſtudied ſeriouſly, reſolving with my ſelf, that God had not given ſo rare ſecrets to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> by them to Tantalize all future poſteritie, but that the ſame might by induſtrie be attained, to which I thought Reading would conduce, but miſtook.</p>
               <p>T'is truth, the books of learned men are of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe to ſuch who join practical operation with Reading, but to bare Readers of them, they are uſeleſs, there ſcarce being one receipt barely ſet down in any ſolid <hi>Author,</hi> that was a real <hi>Adeptus,</hi> but it was and will be found to be either trivial or falfe.</p>
               <p>And to give each man his due, I muſt needs thankfully acknowledge, that from <hi>Helmonts</hi> vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings I have reaped more real benefit (as to ſolid learning) then from any that I have read, or met vvith, either <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>Moderne,</hi> in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of vvhoſe diſcoveries, I have ſpent theſe fourteen years, not have I the leaſt cauſe given me ſince of Repentance, that ever I undertook them.</p>
               <p>He may be truly called, <hi>Paracelſus Great Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> to vvhoſe Writings the World is more behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding then the ungratefulneſs of this Age will ſuffer
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51297:51"/>to be acknowledged, hower, after Ages will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his worth, when many <hi>Scioliſts</hi> will be buried in oblivion.</p>
               <p>T'was firſt through his incitation and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that I was ſet upon the ſearch of the <hi>immortal diſſolving Liquour,</hi> called by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> his <hi>liquour Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaheſt,</hi> of which in my ſecond Treatiſe, I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſufficiently as the order of the diſcourſe did direct and lead me.</p>
               <p>This Liquour (to be ingenious) took me up a great time, as accounting that nothing would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main difficult in Medicine, when that was once attained, and indeed it is a noble <hi>Ens,</hi> fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the time and ſtudie of all who deſire to be Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>But remembring and conſidering <hi>Helmonts</hi> checking Concluſion, <hi>Scientia datur non niſi electis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, per longam annorum &amp; laborum experientiam, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficienti ſanitate, &amp; pecuniâ inſtructis, nec peccatorum gravamine, indignitatem meritis:</hi> Which in Engliſh ſounds thus, <hi>This Science or Skill, is not given, but only to ſuch, whom God shall chooſe, by means of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of many years ſpent in labours, where thoſe who ſearch after it, are ſufficiently provided, both of money, and health, and by a ſinful converſation, shall not render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unworthie thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that unleſs a man have lands to live of (and ſuch as have, are rarely favourers, or followers of <hi>Philoſophie</hi>) he muſt provide himſelf of ſome lucri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous experiments, in the mean while, to defray charges, and help him to live, or elſe his <hi>Philoſophie</hi> will go neer to be ſtarved it ſelf, and to ſtarve the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> before this grayheaded experience, which with much pains, is the <hi>teacher</hi> of <hi>Secrets,</hi> can be reached unto.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:51297:52"/>
               <p>To my comfort I can ſay it, that my ſtudies and endeavours upon and for the great <hi>Liquor,</hi> were not unſucceſsful, yet do I and ſhall I diſcommend that Zeal, that carried me on in the ſearch of it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the neglect of all other things, which had I not done, but proſecuted each thing gradually, ſecuring my ground gotten, to be a ſupport for me on all occaſions; before I had proceeded on winning new, which is the only way, I had done better, and this I recommend to others, that they may learn by me.</p>
               <p>Nor is it aliene from this old <hi>Philoſophers</hi> advice, which is <hi>firſt to get a diſſolver, that may be Immortal and Homogeneall, &amp;c.</hi> as any one may read his Counſel in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Feavers.</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>If you cannot attain to that hidden fire, yet learn to make the</hi> Salt <hi>of</hi> Tartar <hi>Volatile, that by it you may make your Diſſolutions,</hi> the <hi>Encomium</hi> of which, I leave to every one who can and liſt to read, in the Authour himſelf.</p>

               <p>IN the former Book, to wit, the ſecond, I did follow the diviſion of <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> according to the diſtinction of <hi>medicines</hi> which it conteins, either <hi>univerſal</hi> or <hi>ſpecifick,</hi> in proſecuting of which diviſion, we came to the diſtinction of the <hi>Keies,</hi> which are in the <hi>art,</hi> by them to unlock, to prepare, and perfect Bodies, in order, and with an eye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Medicine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51297:52"/>
               <p>This method brought us to diſcourſe of the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor Alchaheſt,</hi> the great univerſal diſſolver of all bodies, without the leaſt loſs of virtue, or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its weight.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now come to the other inferiour <hi>Keies,</hi> and Medicines of a lower ranke, than thoſe preparable by that <hi>Art,</hi> and forementioned <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Subordinate <hi>Liquour,</hi> then to the <hi>great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolver</hi> is the Spirit of <hi>Volatile Alcalies,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak here but briefly, reſerving a more full and clear manifeſtation of them, to an Intire Tractate on that Subject, intituled <hi>De Myſteriis Alcalium,</hi> which I purpoſe ſhortly ſhall ſee the light.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> are Bodies of excellent virtue, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Helmont,</hi> who ſaith of them, <hi>That fixed</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies <hi>being brought to volatilitie, equal the virtue of the great</hi> Arcana, <hi>For being endowed with an inciſive, or reſolving Virtue, they do penetrate even to the Limen of the fourth digeſtion, and reſolve whatever praenatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral coagulation they find in the Veins: and in a word, their Spirit is of ſo exquiſite a penetrative Nature, that where they reach not, no other thing in the World will be found to reach;</hi> A noble commendation and in which he is not falſe in the leaſt, and therefore I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on this ſubject with what fulneſs I may, not to prejudice that other Treatiſe on this peculiar Subject, which I even now mentioned, and which I intend ſhortly ſhall come abroad into the World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Generation</hi> of them, and the <hi>Philoſophicall ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> about their <hi>fixity</hi> and <hi>poſsibility</hi> to be made <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,</hi> I ſhal leave here untouched, as beſt befitting an intire <hi>Philoſophicall Tractate</hi> of the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51297:53"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> then, through Arts craft, and Natures help, may be made <hi>volatile,</hi> and by them, excellent Medicaments may be prepared, ſuch to wit, by which all Medicines abſolutely required to the Cure of any diſeaſe may be prepared.</p>
               <p>The excellent virtue and uſe of <hi>Alcalies</hi> appears from their applicableneſs to <hi>Sulphurs</hi> both <hi>minerall</hi> and <hi>vegetable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In it any <hi>Sulphur</hi> is extracted, out of any mean <hi>minerall</hi> or <hi>inferiour mettall,</hi> inſomuch, that <hi>Lead</hi> onely, by mediation of <hi>fixed Salts,</hi> will ſuffer its Elements of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and ☿ to be diſſolved, and will become a running <hi>Argent vive,</hi> the <hi>Sulphurous</hi> and <hi>Saline parts</hi> being imbibed in the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> by mean of which alſo, they may by art be <hi>volatized.</hi>

               <p>Hence it is, that if ♁ be melted with an <hi>Alcalie</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> the <hi>Salts</hi> which imbibe the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> being liquefied either in water, or in a moiſt place of themſelves, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of the ♁ runnes down, and is inviſibly conteined in the <hi>Lixivium</hi> of the <hi>Salts,</hi> which becauſe it will colour the hands of ſuch as touch it with a <hi>Golden Colour,</hi> by reaſon of its inviſibly conteined <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which by preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation with an acid <hi>liquor</hi> may be made to appear (together with an intollerable ſtink) in a red form, is by the <hi>Tyrocynists</hi> named, <hi>Sulphur Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii Auratum Diaphoreticum,</hi> a trivial toy, as by them uſed, but which may be exalted to a moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Virtue.</p>
               <p>Which that it may be done let theſe <hi>Salts</hi> impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnated

               <p>This ſnow is a <hi>Panacaea</hi> of ♁, purging certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without vomit or nauſeouſneſſe, even in the weakeſt Bodies, and without griping, and is a cure for many (and thoſe <hi>Chronical</hi>) Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
               <p>But to proceed to a further exaltation of its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Take this ſnow, and according to the right Art of diſtillation, proceed with it, to wit mixing it with <hi>Potters Earth</hi> dried, and by degrees of fire diſtil it untill all come over (which by <hi>Cohobation</hi> is obteined,) leaving behind only a damned black inſipid Earth, the Spirit being tincted, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, to colour reſembling a potable liquour of <hi>Gold,</hi> being of a deep tincture, of which five or ſix drops daily adminiſtred, will not fail (even in the moſt deplorable caſes) that may be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>

                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:51297:54"/>(as I taught before,) it then gives it a metalline fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xitie, after the ſame manner, though in a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate degree of nobleneſs, with the fixation of it in <hi>Helmonts Horizontall Gold,</hi> which is made and fixed by the Liquour <hi>Alchaheſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are then three waies of operation upon this volatized <hi>Alcali,</hi> in order to its application to metalline Bodies.</p>
               <p>Firſt the <hi>Alcali</hi> is volatized, that is, regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by death and life, and brought into a totally volatile Salt (which is of great virtue of it ſelf.) this diſtilled according to <hi>Art,</hi> gives that Noble <hi>Liquour</hi> of which <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Paracelſus</hi> give ſuch noble <hi>Encomiums,</hi> that wherever that ſpirit reacheth not, no other will reach.</p>
               <p>This Spirit is volatile and ſaline (not acid) and therefore more difficult to be attained by our pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationers and Scioliſts) it diſſolves all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, onely is coagulated upon them (being diſſolved) into a volatile Salt, which being then ſublimed from the diſſolved <hi>Calx,</hi> doth in imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mettals, raiſe their <hi>Sulphur,</hi> together with it ſelf, and in perfect mettals, it by oft Circulation doth the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly then, this <hi>Alcali</hi> thus regenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a volatile Salt, if mixed with the <hi>Calx</hi> of either ♀, ♃, ♄, or the <hi>Metallus maſculus,</hi> or with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> of ♁, and with them diſtilled, it doth make them volatile, and each time the diſtilled Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put upon the <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> is coagulated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Proceed by <hi>Cohabation,</hi> til your ſign appear, which it behoves each Philoſopher diligently to attend, Coagulate then your Spirit, in which is the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Sulphur hidden, &amp; with <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wine</hi> dephleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51297:55"/>extract the metalline tincture from the Salt, which when the extracting ſpirit is drawn away, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains fragrant and very ſweet, and is of wonderful virtue, little inferiour to any glorified Sulphur, by any Alchaheſtical operation.</p>
               <p>But thirdly, (and that way I rather chooſe) let your <hi>Alcalie</hi> be firſt of all melted with the Calx of any imperfect Mettal, and then you have the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur married with the Salt, and by the fuſion of fire ſomewhat opened, this mixture proceed with after the way of volatizing Salt of <hi>Tartar perſe,</hi> and both being thus putrified and regenerated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do after in their volatizing, more thoroughly unite together, which for that end, proceed with by cohobation, ſo long until they be wholly vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: coagulate the Spirit then into a volatile Salt and uſe it either with the Salt united, or extract the Sulphur which is fragrant, and ſweet, with pure Spirit of Wine, and reckon your ſelf then Maſter of a medicine balſamical, which you can never enough value and eſteem.</p>
               <p>All the ſecret then, is to know how to make <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies</hi> volatile, which is a Secret that will never come to the knowledge of a lazie perſon, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Putationer, it is one of Natures ſecret <hi>Keies,</hi> to fixe and to volatize, which in all her three Kingdomes ſhe performes every day unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly.</p>
               <p>Let many Tunnes or never ſo little quantitie of theſe fixed Salts, be laid in any Field, and in few months all would be tranſmuted into a volatile <hi>ſalt,</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Calx,</hi> and <hi>Ashes</hi> inrich grounds for <hi>Corn,</hi> and yet our Philoſophers now adaies, have not learned to imitate Nature, in her moſt ordinary operations.</p>

               <p>The truth is, they who ſhould mind theſe things, are idle and conceited, they cannot endure the pains of Search, and beſides pride themſelves, as if all knowledge were with them alreadie, and in the mean time are readie to vexe and perſecute any, that will not goe on in the old Road with them.</p>
               <p>However, Truth muſt and will prevail, and they who for long time, have contemned it, ſhall find themſelves juſtly at laſt contemned.</p>
               <p>What I write, I write from the treaſurie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and I know and am aſſured, that my Book will be a welcome Iewel to many, although a goad in the ſide, and a prick to the very heart of others, yet let them fret and break their ſpleen, they never can, nor ſhall prevail againſt what I here vvrite.</p>
               <p>Are not our Princes of <hi>Zoan</hi> fools? Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vvhile like the ſavage Indians, they adore Glaſs, Beads, Copper Bracelets, and trifling loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Glaſſes, mean time contemning Gold and Pearls.</p>

               <p>But to return to our purpoſe, from which we have a little digreſſed, namely, to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of preparing Medicines, which whoever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the Care of Lives, and would peforme his undertaking Conſcionably, muſt attend care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>

But by ſuperaddition of a Ferment, for the extraction of the hidden Virtue, by ſuſpending their Virulencie, by ſubſtitution of one qualitie for another, or by compoſition of due ingredients, ſtirring up new qualities, ſuch as were not in the</hi> Concretes <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie.</hi>

               <p>Which Counſel if well attended and followed, it would in ſhort time ruine thoſe Shambles of Butcherie unto thouſands of poor mortals, the <hi>Apothecaries shops,</hi> which have been more fatal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mankind than ever was the <hi>ſword,</hi> by means of which multitudes have died, through the abſolute virulencie of their medicines (ſo called, but real poiſon, not corrected but Ironically) and many more for want of due help, which in their Slops is not to be found.</p>
               <p>To correct them is impoſſible, they have grown up ſo long a time, that they ſeem to have made preſcription upon Nature for their future ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhall not therefore waſh a Blackmore in labouring to reclaim them, but inſtruct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and induſtrious in better preparations.</p>
               <p>For the virulencie of ſome <hi>Simples</hi> cannot be corrected, nor the defects (as crudities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) of others taken away by beating into powders, (which they call <hi>ſpecies</hi> when mingled) nor boiling with

               <p>Vain therefore is the intention of cure that is pretended by theſe waies, and abſurd are thoſe Idle promiſes of <hi>Syrups</hi> to reach and to heal the <hi>Lungs,</hi> when as the <hi>Liver</hi> that is much neerer canot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched either by <hi>Syrups</hi> or <hi>Decoctions,</hi> what ever the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leniſts</hi> perſwade their deluded Patients.</p>

               <p>This is manifeſt in <hi>Sea-ſalt,</hi> which paſſing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the <hi>Stomach</hi> and of the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the <hi>Meſaraick veins,</hi> and goeth along with the <hi>ſemidigeſted bloud</hi> or <hi>cruor,</hi> until the <hi>urinary ſeparation,</hi> in which it lies formally the ſame as it was when it was taken in, and is from thence ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in its intire ſubſtance, form and virtue.</p>

               <p>I would know of any <hi>Galeniſt,</hi> if or no the virtue of ſuch <hi>ſimples</hi> conſiſt in the vomitive or purgative facultie, and if ſo, what is become of it by this ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie preparation? There is no evaſion of the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51297:61"/>the matter of fact an eaſie experiment will convince, the reaſon it is that I now crave of them.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51297:63"/>make a medicine without decoction, as it is to eat young <hi>Cucumers</hi> without pickling, beſides many have a venome adhering to their cruditie, which provokes the <hi>Archeus</hi> to rage and furie, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the diſeaſe is diſturbed, and a light irradiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the benevolence of the <hi>Simple</hi> is apparent, through the dark cloud of <hi>anxiety, vomitings,</hi> and <hi>looſneſs</hi> of the <hi>belly,</hi> which the ſtupid Doctour mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cries out, <hi>O excellent Medicine!</hi> not conſidering that if coming as an enemie, which Nature would not admit, but ſhut her parlour, and cloſet doors againſt it, and muſtering her forces endeavoured to throw it out of its firſt Room, or at leaſt to beat it out at the back door, and yet it left a raie (as it were) of its hidden virtue behind it, vvhat vvould it have done, had it been ſtript of all its hoſtile malignitie, that ſo Nature might have been famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar vvith it, and led it up and dovvn from room to room, and from cloſet to cloſet, to the very entrance of the privie chamber, to vvhich is no acceſs, but onely to the Prince, or his very intire friend, vvhich is far beyond a reconciled Enemie, Such as are <hi>Aromatick balſamick eſſences.</hi>

               <p>In a vvord, a humid decoction or any digeſtion in a heat, that is not burning, though it ripen cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, yet it makes no change of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> if once the heat be graduated above a <hi>pepantick</hi> or <hi>fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heat,</hi> vvhich is <hi>putrefactive</hi> ever (vvhere the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is capable) and ſo the Parent of <hi>Tranſmutation,</hi> as may appear in <hi>meat</hi> or moiſt <hi>Herbes</hi> kept in a <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile heat,</hi> ſuch as is the heat of a <hi>Horſe belly,</hi> or <hi>horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung,</hi> vvhich is proportionable to the heat of <hi>Man</hi> vvhen he is in a <hi>feverish temper,</hi> This heat incites a ferment, and that cauſeth a tranſmutation as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating or burning heat doth cauſe the death of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51297:64"/>the <hi>Compound,</hi> and by Conſequence a new product which is <hi>Filius Ignis,</hi> But the ſeminal virtue of the <hi>Concrete,</hi> is not totally extinguiſhed, but by open burning, for in a cloſe ſeparative heat, the parts are confuſedly wrought upon, partly retaining the <hi>vita media</hi> of the former Concrete, but eminently altered from their former ſpecifick forms, through the active impreſſion of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> whoſe Character they receive.</p>
               <p>Whereas in an humid heat, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> is unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, though the crudities are by decoction taken away, yet this may be without loſs of one grain of Subſtance, the formal properties of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete remaining notwithſtanding, So <hi>Beef, Pork, Mutton, Fish,</hi> or <hi>Fowl,</hi> by boiling are not changed (ſave onely from raw to ripe) but the Specifick determinateneſs remains ſtill, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Colour, Taſt, Smell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which were appropriate to the rawneſs are changed, into others which follow decoction, yet keeping within the bounds of the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction were continued till a <hi>Gelatina,</hi> or <hi>Ius Conſummatum</hi> be produced, yet theſe <hi>Iellies</hi> or <hi>Broths,</hi> keep their ſeminal and formally diſtinct properties, ſo that <hi>Cockbroth, Veal broth,</hi> or <hi>Mutton broth,</hi> are diſtinctly to be known one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor are they radically changed, but by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of a Ferment (which is not to be found beyond the degree of a <hi>feverish</hi> or <hi>pepantick heat</hi>) or by a burning degree of fire, which is <hi>Mors artificialis compoſiti,</hi> and would prove <hi>ſeminum extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> were it but ſuffered to act openly, with a free flame or burning.</p>
               <p>To apply what hath been ſaid to our purpoſe, I would ask the <hi>Supercilious Galeniſt</hi> what he can ſay
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51297:64"/>to oppoſe the Reaſon of this Diſcourſe, That <hi>wheat</hi> is a wholeſome Grain all <hi>Europe</hi> knows, yet it wants not its malignant crudities, till it be Baked, as every Baker can tell you, and every Houſewife can inſtruct her ſelf, ſo it is in meat, ſo in Fiſh, and ſo in every thing, yea although ſome tender leaves of Herbes be uſed and approved wholeſome raw, yet this only to ſound Stomacks, but to weak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and crazie healths, even theſe and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Fruits</hi> require boiling, baking, or ſtewing, which convinces that ſo prepared they are the more wholſome.</p>
               <p>Only the <hi>Galeniſt</hi> can be content to have his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments crude, that is, his <hi>Elaterium, Zalap, Mecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achan, Briony, &amp;c.</hi> which beſide cruditie have alſo a malignant venome, not to be taken away without previous preparation.</p>
               <p>Beſides all <hi>vegetable concretes,</hi> at leaſt moſt of them have their <hi>Craſis</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> involved in a <hi>Cummous, Viſcous Subſtance,</hi> as a Nut in its ſhell, which in Herbs or vegetable grain created for mans nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is the Object on which the digeſtive faculty is exerciſed, which alſo if it be taken away by <hi>Ferment,</hi> although wholeſome drinks may be made of them, yet they want their former <hi>nutritive</hi> facultie of meat, as appears in wine, and Beer, which while Barlie, and Grapes were apt for Food, and nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>But ſo ſoon as the <hi>glutinous viſcous Nature</hi> was <hi>volatized</hi> by <hi>Ferment,</hi> and ſo formally tranſmuted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a New Creature, it became of food a wholſome drink, of vertue to refreſh and cheer the ſpirits (if moderately taken) or to beſot and ſtupifie them (if immoderately uſed) which effects in the Grain or Grapes was not to be found,</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51297:65"/>
               <p>Whence it is evident, that when Art by the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduction of a <hi>Ferment</hi> hath volatized, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally altered the viſcoſity of a <hi>vegetall Concrete,</hi> it then as to its Spirit (which was produced of the foreſaid <hi>Gummous ſubſtance</hi>) is not lyable to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks dig eſtion, but is in it only ſeparated, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually hath acceſs to the Heart, and the ſubtle <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial fibrae,</hi> which are the conveying channels of the Spirits from one noble part to another, and their effect is warming, reviving, refreſhing, &amp; cheering, which they do more powerfully by how much the <hi>Liquour</hi> is more <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For what ever is digeſted in the Stomach, is firſt made <hi>chile,</hi> or an <hi>acid Cremor,</hi> which after is by the <hi>ferment</hi> of the <hi>Liver,</hi> tranſmuted into a <hi>ſanguine ſalt,</hi> and ſo the <hi>bloud</hi> is <hi>ſalt,</hi> which then is not altered, but only refined, and ſo ſent to the <hi>Heart,</hi> where it is inſpired with a ſpirit of life, which is <hi>Helmonts aura vitalis,</hi> and then the <hi>Cruor Hepaticus</hi> becomes <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Arterialis,</hi> which is the conveier of the <hi>Vital ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> to all the Body, bedewing each part with a vital breath or dew, by which the Spirits ſpent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the ſeveral functions of the Bodie are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, which is the laſt end propounded by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her appetible deſire of meat and drink.</p>
               <p>For Nature doth not in thirſt deſire Beer or Wine as ſuch, but as moiſture, for the ſupply of the decaied <hi>Latex,</hi> though provident Art, hath married the Water to a ſpirit that is familiar to Nature, that at once both the thirſt may beſlacked, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits cheared. But of this more fully in my <hi>Treatiſe</hi> intituled, <hi>The Method and Myſtery of Curing diſeaſes,</hi> which I intend very ſhortly to publiſh, to which I remit the Reader.</p>
               <p>To draw then what hath been ſaid to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51297:65"/>intent and purpoſe, we ſhall lay down a few Concluſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That all <hi>Vegetall Concretes</hi> have a <hi>gummous viſcous Subſtance,</hi> which in <hi>Vegetables</hi> created for nouriſhment, is the object on which the ferment of the Stomach acts, and out of which it attracts <hi>Chile.</hi> This is apparent in all Broths, and Extracts of <hi>Grain</hi> or <hi>Herbs,</hi> or the juice of <hi>Fruits,</hi> which (the aquous part being exhaled) leave a <hi>Rob,</hi> or <hi>Extract,</hi> clammy thick, and of the Conſiſtence of <hi>Tarre,</hi> although not pinguous, but viſcous, and gummous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Gummous bodie, if it be by a Ferment volatized, produceth a Vinous Spirit, formally diſtinct from what it was before, and then no longer a proper object for the Ferment of the Stomack to work on, and therefore then no longer nutritive as food, though refreſhing as Spirits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All <hi>Vegetables</hi> are not deſtined for food, ſome being reſinous, or woody, or otherwiſe of an unyeelding nature to the Ferment of the Stomack, are rejected, and may pervert the Digeſtion, but never ſatisfie the Appetite, others are of a malignant outſide, and ſo the Stomach abhors them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whatever is digeſted, is received in <hi>Oeconomiam vitalem,</hi> into which if it bring any peregrine qualitie, this ſtreight becomes hoſtile, and engenders bad Bloud, and it is well if the wrong be expiated with <hi>boils, ſcabs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly. Being rejected either by vomit, if the hoſtilitie be more apparent, or by ſiege, if not ſo virulent, it is conveied (as an Enemie) to the place of Excrements, vvhere, vvhen it comes to receive
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51297:66"/>the ferment of the place (which is ſtercorious and excrementitious,) it cauſeth a venemous malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Gas,</hi> and reſolves and corrupts the aliment of the Bowells, whence come thoſe gripings, and filthy ſtools which are produced.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, for the ſake of that malignity, the whole ſtock of Chyle that is in the ſtomack, and the half tranſmuted Chyle, which is in the paſſage from the ſtomack, toward the <hi>Meſaraicks</hi> is rejected as unfit for nouriſhment, and ſo what <hi>Broth</hi> ſoever is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, isalſo infected, vitiated and rejected, till the malignant character impreſſed, be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. This is the Noble effect of the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> Art.</p>
               <p>From whence we may gather on moſt unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ground, that that which is medicinal is not, nor ought to be liable to the tranſmutative digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the ſtomack, for then it becomes vitall, and ſo no more medicinal, for what ever is peregrine, although it be but the <hi>Vita media,</hi> yet thoſe light qualities of the <hi>Magnum oportet,</hi> muſt ſubmit to the juriſdiction of the ſeveral digeſtions, or elſe the whole is abhorred as hoſtile.</p>
               <p>But ſpirituall eſſences, although they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially contained in ſeveral concretes, yet ſo, as not to be found, and brought to light by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſtion of the ſtomack, which makes a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall tranſmutation of what it can maſter into <hi>Chyle,</hi> which is farre different from what by Art, and the ſuperinduction of a different ferment might have been had, For farre diſtinct is that which the ſtomack produceth out of grapes from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, which Art produceth by firſt changing the juice of the grape into wine.</p>
               <p>Yea and the product follows the diſpoſition of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51297:66"/>the matter, as is evident in the Iuice of Grapes, which after Fermentation, the Artiſt may (if he pleaſe) turn into Vineger, and which without fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation will onely ſtink and putrifie, as after it may become either Vinous or Acetous, according to the Artiſts pleaſure, which products do ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ each from other, though both from one and the ſame material Subſtance. But this onely as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. In my other Treatiſe of the <hi>Method and Myſtery of Medicine,</hi> I ſhall fully and purpoſely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this Subject.</p>
               <p>Three things then I briefly condemn and reprove the Galeniſts vegetable <hi>Apparatus</hi> of Medicaments (for as to their Mineral ſtock, it rather deſerves a Satyr, than a convincing reproof) which render their Method ridiculous, hazardous, uncertain and dangerous.</p>
               <p>The firſt, and not a trivial fault is their Crude immaturitie, which no Grain, fruit, herb, or root is without, that is formeat, witneſſe Bread unbaked Roots unboiled, or raw Fruits, Coleworts, or Cabbage, without previous decoction, by which Artichokes, Turnips, Parſnips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of harſh, crude and unhealthie, become ſound and whole ſome nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, Yea even Beer it ſelf, that hath undergone a fermentation, if drunk new, requires its defect of Age to be ſupplied by decoction, elſe both it and new Wines, new Perry, Cyder, and Methe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glin, are not without ſenſible offence to the Body, which annoiance is either to be taken away by full Decoction, or by Age which is equivalent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction.</p>
               <p>Now can anybe ſo ſtupid to imagine, that <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb,</hi> or <hi>Zalap, &amp;c.</hi> have not, beſide their vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous malignitie, the unnatural Cruditie of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51297:67"/>a <hi>Carroot</hi> or <hi>Parſnip,</hi> and therefore as the one is fit meat, ſo the other fit medicine onely for a Hog, the Stomack of man, being by the Creatours ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, too noble and curious a receptacle for ſuch crude ſimples, vvhich had they no other fault, yet this alone vvere enough to diſcommend them.</p>
               <p>Fie upon thoſe ſelf-condemning Doctours, vvho vvill accuſe ravv <hi>Oatmeal</hi> as the cauſe of the <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fickneſs</hi> in maids, and ravv fruit, eſpecially unripe, as the cauſe of Wormes, ſharp humours, indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and Obſtructions in Children, and yet vvill preſcribe ravv <hi>Rhabarbe, Zalap, Mechoacan,</hi> or <hi>Sene</hi> infuſed (vvhich is all one vvith ravv, vvitneſs the infuſion of <hi>Malt</hi> before boiling, called commonly <hi>Wort</hi>) for a Cure of the like griefs, I ſpeak it to their ſhame, vvith hopes (if poſſible) to amend them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond deficiencie in their Medicines, is the gummous terreſtrictie, vvhich accompanies all <hi>Vegetals,</hi> vvhich they take no care to mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and overcome, before the Stomach be cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred vvith them.</p>
               <p>This Gummouſneſs I before ſhevved by ocular demonſtration in all thoſe mock preparations, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called Extracts, vvhich is moſt evident in the <hi>Reſina Zalappae, Scammonii, &amp;c.</hi> I diſpute not vvith vvhat the extraction be made vvith, vvhether vvith Water, or vvith a diſtilled Phlegme or Devv of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or any other diſtilled Water, or vvith Spirit of Wine (though that is of all the forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the beſt) yet none of theſe diſtinguiſh the gummous viſcous parts from the pure, ſubtle, and ſaline parts, and ſo the Stomack either finds a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vvithout benefit, or at leaſt the benefit ſo clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51297:67"/>with its burden, that the <hi>Archeus</hi> reaps not the due efficacie of the Medicine.</p>
               <p>For as I touched before; the Stomack will not let any gummous viſcous Subſtance paſs the <hi>Pilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Duodenum</hi> into the <hi>Meſaraicks,</hi> nor will the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the ſecond Digeſtion ſuffer ſuch abuſe, but it muſt be either concocted into Chile, and ſo received into the oeconomie of <hi>Vital principles</hi> and by conſequence no longer a <hi>Medicine,</hi> or if it be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too refractory or too malignant, to undergoe thatſtomachical maceration, it is proſcribed among <hi>Excrements,</hi> the <hi>Craſis</hi> (like the Nut) never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its effects, being clogged and made ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual by the gummoſitie, which as a ſhell keeps in its benignirie from diffuſing its ſelf.</p>
               <p>For the appetite of the Stomack craves nothing but meat and drink, and by conſequence whatever it finds too groſs for drink, and unapt for food it rejects to the Excrements, without further examination.</p>
               <p>Moſt abſurd then is that of many Doctors who preſcribe Medicinal Herbes, in Cock or Chicken Broth, or in Jellie made of knuckles of Veal, not conſidering that meat and Medicine are two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and diſtinct things, and while thus they think to beguile Nature by medicated broths, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the digeſtion, and verefie the Proverb, in their Patients, cauſing them <hi>Medicè, id eſt, miſerè vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Archeus</hi> finding in the ſtomack broth or Jellies, which are the uſual fit objects for its Ferment to work upon for nutriment ſake, begins to attempt the Digeſtion, till finding the <hi>Fucus</hi> it rejects all, in effect crying out with the Sonnes of the Prophets, <hi>O Medice! mors eſt

And if any of this <hi>Chyle</hi> in which is an unnatural exotick qualitie, come to the ſecond Digeſtion, what fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, exorbitancies, obſtructions, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances it produces, few who have run through a <hi>Calenical method</hi> (for ſome <hi>Chronical Diſeaſe</hi>) but can tell to their Coſt, and can read this Lecture in themſelves, with a <hi>Probatum eſt,</hi> upon their own Bodie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, We accuſe and condemne the venemous malignitie of many <hi>Simples,</hi> which they moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly call <hi>Medicaments,</hi> as <hi>Scammony, Elaterium, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aron Aſarum, Colocynthida,</hi> with many others which it would be tedious to recount.</p>
               <p>I eaſily grant, and admit that under the mask of <hi>Virulency,</hi> moſt noble virtues for moſt part are hid (although it is no neceſſarie conſequence that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies it ſhould be ſo) yet the Medicinal virtue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſts not either in the <hi>Emetick</hi> or <hi>Laxative ſacultie</hi> of a <hi>Simple,</hi> which it works <hi>Qua Venenum,</hi> but the <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick excellency</hi> is far more ſecretly hid, and not to be commanded but by a true and Philoſophick prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Let Fools admire thoſe qualities as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal which abate by <hi>Decoction,</hi> and by compleat <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction</hi> are wholly taken away; We know that they are but ſo many Venomes, and are <hi>Concomitant ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidonts</hi> of the <hi>Cruditie,</hi> and <hi>Cummous viſcoſity</hi> of ſuch <hi>Virulent Concretes,</hi> of which in the firſt <hi>Ens</hi> are no footſteps to be found.</p>
               <p>I yeild moreover that there are many <hi>Simples</hi> not intended by Nature for Meat, that are of excellent Virtue, as they are, ſome <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> as <hi>Carduus,

               <p>We ſhewed how that nothing may be admitted to the ſecond, and conſequently to the third di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, that is of a Corporeous ſubſtance, till it be macerated by the ferment of the firſt, and whatever is ſo digeſted becomes alimentary chile, and no longer a Medicine, and if any exotick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities render it unfit for Nutriment, the <hi>Archeus</hi> (who is Gods Vicegerent, and quickly perceives it) rejects it into the <hi>draught,</hi> where when it receivs the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51297:70"/>ſtercoreous Ferment of the Bowels, it excites a fermental <hi>Gas, Pontique,</hi> and <hi>Griping,</hi> cauſing wringing of the Bowels, and Wind with looſe Stools, by miſtake called a Purging (being indeed, onely a Venemous Impreſſion on the bowels.)</p>
               <p>I ſhewed that how excellent Virtues ſoever a Simple may have, yet that <hi>Craſis</hi> is ſhut up in the Gummouſneſs, as a Nut in the Shell, unleſs it be a Volatile Alcalizateneſs which is apparent, in many Simples, which yet is at the beſt clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Viſcous faeculencie, to which it is united.</p>
               <p>I made it likewiſe clear, how the Stomack had appetite to nothing, but with an eye to convert it into aliment, which nutritive object was incloſed in the gummous ſubſtance, which if it digeſt, it makes Chile (not a Medicine) for which if it be unapt it rejects it, not conſidering the Medicinal ſecrets contained in it, of which the Stomack takes no cognizance.</p>
               <p>I now come to the true and Philoſophical prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of real and true medicines, whoſe character I ſhall give briefly, to ſatisfie the Ingenuous Reader.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, In oppoſition to what I blamed in the Methodiſts medicines, their crude immaturities are taken away either by Ferment, or addition of that which is a Fermental Virtue, For although in the former Chapter I inſtanced in decoction as a Convenient Remedie againſt theſe raw Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet I did never intend ſolitarie decoction for the proper mean of Medicinal preparation, and that firſt, becauſe it diſtinguiſheth not between the gummous, and the purely ſaline parts which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51297:71"/>is abſolutely required in the right preparation of medicaments, and ſecondly becauſe the fire, though it do not formally tranſmute (in a humid decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yet it doth notably alter the qualities of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as are odorous, and whoſe <hi>Craſis</hi> lies in a light eſſential <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as <hi>Cinnamon, Mace, Nutmegs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In preparing of which if at any time decoction be uſed, yet let it be ſo, that the odorous and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential parts may be ſaved, that ſo they being again married, and more deeply united with their own more fixed ſubſtances, both may become one <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xir</hi> together.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Then a due preparation diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth between that which is gummous, and that which is purely ſaline, either by ſeparating one from the other, or by macerating the viſcous terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriety, and by a ſecret digeſtion changing it into either a <hi>ſpiritual Sulphur,</hi> or a <hi>liquable Salt,</hi> for <hi>Salts</hi> and <hi>Sulphurs</hi> are but <hi>Seminum tori,</hi> diſguiſes in which the <hi>Craſis</hi> of <hi>Concretes</hi> are masked, Which are ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively tranſmutable one into another, ſo the juice of Grapes (if decocted) the aquous parts exhaling, the Reſidue becomes a <hi>Rob,</hi> which is gummous and viſcous, this by fermentation is made volatile, and becomes a <hi>ſpiritual Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>burning Spirit,</hi> which by the rectified <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vrine</hi> is wholly turned into a <hi>Volatile Salt,</hi> then which example none can be more plain and convincing, that theſe Principles, or rather ſeveral formes of the ſame Subſtance, are convertible each into other, a terreſtriety or gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous viſcoſity is turned into a <hi>Volatile Spirit,</hi> wholly inflamable, and this into a real pure <hi>Salt,</hi> not infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, and ſo on the other hand, the Tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Salt,</hi> into <hi>Sulphur</hi> is moſt evident in the diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51297:71"/>of <hi>Tartar</hi> which being wholly Saline, and diſſolvable in water, by bare diſtillation is turned the major part of it into an Oil impermiſcible with Water.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Concrete</hi> is once thus changed, then it is no longer as it was before, liable to the <hi>ſtomachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal digeſtion,</hi> but if it be an <hi>Oily Sulphur</hi> (as diſtilled <hi>Oils</hi> are, thoſe eſpecially which riſe by force of fire, and are not drawn with water) they reſiſt the <hi>Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical ferment,</hi> and ſo riſe offenſively ſeveral hours after taking, until the greater part of them are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with the <hi>Excrements</hi> by ſiege, and part of them (eſpecially <hi>Eſsences</hi> drawn with water) being no way hoſtile, are admitted to the porch, as it were of the ſecond digeſtion, where changing their <hi>vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile fatneſs</hi> for an <hi>urinous ſaltneſs,</hi> they work away by the <hi>Vrine,</hi> as is evident in <hi>Oyl</hi> of <hi>Terebinth, Mace, Nutmeg, &amp;c.</hi> of which the <hi>Vrine</hi> will ſmell apparently ſome hours after the taking of them.</p>
               <p>But if a <hi>Volatile Salt</hi> be made either of the <hi>Oils</hi> or <hi>Tinctures</hi> of <hi>Vegetals,</hi> this then needs no farther tranſmutation, only the <hi>Alcaliza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eneſs</hi> of the <hi>Salt</hi> is ſatiated with the aciditie of the Stomack, and afterward it paſſeth to the ſecond digeſtion, and ſo forward to the third, reſolving in its paſſage all preternatural coagulations, vvhich are the cauſe of obſtructions, and expelling them being reſolved, by <hi>Vrine</hi> and <hi>Sweat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True, this Salt thus paſſing receives from the <hi>Stomachical acidity</hi> a ſaturating of its <hi>Alcalizate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> if it be <hi>Lixiviate,</hi> but this is no more to be accounted a tranſmutation, then when an <hi>Alcaly</hi> is ſatiated by reiterate pouring on of Spirit of <hi>Vineger,</hi> in which the <hi>Alcaly</hi> receives an alteration,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51297:72"/>but not a tranſmutation, proportionably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in this caſe, this Salt being of a pure liqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature, and no way hoſtile, is admitted with out ſcruple, and doth homage as I may ſay to the Ferments, that is, takes an external Character of their qualities, at leaſt, ſhewes no reſiſtance to them, and ſo paſſeth along with the Chile to the <hi>Meſaraicks,</hi> being firſt cloathed with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal habit of the places, through which it paſſeth as a friendly ſtranger, acting as it goes along, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Specifick Virtues which it receives from the <hi>Creatour</hi> (which ſpecifick virtues remain, not wholly extinct till it comes to the very ſuburbs of the fourth digeſtion) becauſe it is admitted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a ſtranger, whereas were it to be made one with the Chile, which is deſtined for nouriſhment, it could not be admitted to the firſt ſtep of the ſecond Digeſtion, till it were totally ſtript of all its qualities, which it had in its Concrete Being, ſuch is the difference between Being admitted along with the digeſtible matter, from one digeſtion to another, as a Friendly ſtranger, and being received formally into the Subſtance of what is digeſted, the one is the entertainment of a true Noble Medicament, the other of food deſtin'd to nuttiment.</p>
               <p>Concerning this Subject many things worthie to be known might be diſcovered, but the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this preſent Task will not permit me large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inſiſt hereon in this place, being inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diſcover ſomewhat briefly, yet fully and plainly, how a ſedulous Artiſt may furniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with a noble <hi>Apparatus</hi> of powerful ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick remedies, for the vanquiſhing and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all kind of diſeaſes, in defect of the more
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51297:72"/>ſecret and ſeldome attained <hi>Arcana,</hi> though I muſt grant, that the cures this way performed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more care in attendance on them, and more judgement in the adminiſtring of Medicines, than thoſe which are performed <hi>Tono uniſono.</hi> And for this cauſe the noble <hi>Helmont</hi> reckoning up his <hi>ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic febrifugall Salts,</hi> which might ſucceed, in the room and defect of his <hi>Horizontal Gold,</hi> Adds, <hi>That if theſe be given in a due doſe, at a due time, and the Patient du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordered, they will never expoſe a faithful Phifician to ſcorn and contempt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thirdly and laſtly, Our Medicaments by a due preparation, have their Venome wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, then is the poiſon of the Viper taken away, and we may ſafely make Theriacle of his fleſh, thus is the paſſage to the Tree of life (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my alluſion) made open, having firſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled the angry Cherub, whoſe flaming ſword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did guard it. Bleſſed be God for ever, who hath called us to theſe preparations, from out of the <hi>faeces</hi> or dregs of vulgar confuſions, by which <hi>ſpecies</hi> are ignorantly confounded, more ignorantly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and many poor Souls, pay the price of their lives, on the ſcore of this perverſe blindneſs, The more is the ſhame! The more is the pitty! The Lord in his due time amend it.</p>
               <p>Come we then, and I preſume not without the Readerslonging expectation, to the manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring Medicaments truly and Philoſophically, ſuch I mean which require not the Liquour <hi>Alcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſt,</hi> for that were to tantalize, and not inſtruct the Reader.</p>
               <p>Our Art of preparation is no other than a practical Commentarie on <hi>Helmonts Legacie,</hi> to ſuch who are not yet ſo farre honoured by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51297:73"/>God as to taſt the virtue and efficacy of the <hi>Circu latum majus,</hi> which is the impatible great diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Liquor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My advice is,</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>not to caſtrate thoſe Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are of excellent and great vertues, but by Art to make them better, and to advance them, by ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their virulency, by extracting their hidden quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by changing offenſive qualities into others, which is done by ſuperinducing a ferntent, or by addition of ſome noble powerfull Medium by which this may be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the illuſtrating of which let me mind the Reader of what I handled more fully before, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that both the crudity, and the venome are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in decoction by little and little, until in the end they become wholly extinct, as the Circles in water made by the falling of a ſtone do by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little vaniſh away, and at laſt diſappear wholly,</p>
               <p>But this we adviſed not as the beſt way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, partly, becauſe it left the gummous vif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſity unconquered, (which is not to be maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by a ferment, that volatizeth it, or elſe it is to be ſeparated by a proper agent, which is of efficacy ſufficient for that purpoſe) but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the fire doth by little and little weaken the ſpecifick <hi>Craſis</hi> of what <hi>Vegetable</hi> concrete is decocted by it: Therefore the moſt deſirable, and truly Philoſophicall way to perform this, is by the addition of an Agent, which is penetrative, and fermentall, that ſo it may without any altering ſenſible heat,
<note place="margin">☞</note> by a ſecret circulation, perform that triumphingly and perfectly, which bare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction doth lamely and imperfectly.</p>
               <p>Such a mean is diligently to be ſought for, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51297:73"/>highly to be prized when found: ſuch a mean is to be found in the Commonwealth of <hi>Alcalies,</hi> then which next to the <hi>Grand Diſſolvent,</hi> Nature hath not afforded a more excellent ſubject that can more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately performe what the Artiſt ſeeks, if it fall into the hands of a mental man, and not of a <hi>Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Scioliſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gave a hint even now, in the laſt foregoing Chapter, that <hi>Alcalies</hi> would at once both ripen the crudities, ſeparate the gummouſneſs, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Venome, where I did but as it were <hi>Ex un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue Leonem,</hi> meaſure <hi>Hercules</hi> by his foot, gueſs at the Valour of <hi>Apollo,</hi> by his ſtrangling the ſerpent while he was yet an Infant in his Cradle, I intended it not as a meaſure of the Virtue of <hi>Alcalies,</hi> but as an eſſay of what might be expected from them, if by an induſtrious and prudent <hi>Artiſt,</hi> they be governed to their ripe Age, if in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, they do ſo much what may for the future be expected from them.</p>
               <p>For an ocular proof of what before I touched, ſee firſt the Cruditie by <hi>Alcalies</hi> maturated, and ripened, It cannot be denied but that crudity is the cauſe of corruption in any corruptible thing, which is ſo predominant in Vegetals, that if moiſt, they being compreſſed, will in few hours begin to heat, a previous ſign of enſuing putrefaction, if drie, in the open Air, they loſe their virtue in a few years, ſome in a few months, if moiſtned, they ſoon Corrupt, Rot, Stink, breed Wormes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Cruditie is but in part taken away by ſolitary Decoction, for boiled Meat, or Herbs, or Seeds will grow Sower, corrupt, and Stink with ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a time, although not ſo ſoon, as raw or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boiled.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:51297:74"/>
               <p>But by means of an <hi>Alcaly</hi> this cruditie is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken away, that as Myrrhe and other Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spices, uſed for the embalming of Carcaſes in <hi>Egypt,</hi> preſerved them from Corruption (uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to all dead bodies of men or Beaſts,) for many yeers, yea, for many Ages, ſo <hi>Alcalies</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Vegetals,
<note place="margin">rindx;</note> both from Ferment and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
               <p>True, the <hi>ſpecies</hi> ſo confected have ſtill a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all internall maturative motion, whereby they aſpire daily to more and more perfection, till they come to an eſſential <hi>Salt,</hi> which terminates this their motion, but this without any tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fermentation, or putrefactive Corruption, ſo that Vegetables thus confected are in a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Motion to perfection, but it is, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their formal, ſpecifick, priſtine Virtues, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced and graduated, not perverted or extinct, as it falls out in all Tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſeparating of the gummous terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriety, may be moſt evident in this example, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve <hi>Opium</hi> in cleer Water, or in Spirit of Wine (that makes no difference here) decant it, or filter it exquiſitely, that it be very cleer and tranſparent, then add to it equal part of a ſtrong <hi>Lixivium</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> and ſtraight with a ſtrong urinous ſent, you ſhall ſee a ſeparation, not of a ſmall inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble quantitie, but a large quantity of a Reſinous Curd, as it is in the mixing of Wine, with warme Milk, let it ſtand in a ſimpering heat, till this <hi>Coagulum</hi> be got together, then filter it again, and you ſhall find a reſinous, or rather gummous Subſtance, like unto <hi>Aloes,</hi> for Colour, and breaking, bitter and ſtupefying, and ſo it is in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51297:74"/>all other Concretes, as <hi>Wormwood, Rue, Cardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp;c.</hi> onely let the ſolution and infuſion be as full of the <hi>Simple</hi> as the moiſture will diſſolve. This is to be found alſo in the ordinary elixation of <hi>malt</hi> (with us called <hi>Wort</hi>) and briefly in the decocted li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quour of all <hi>Coucretes,</hi> in them eſpecially which are of an eminent taſt: can any man deſire a more plain proof and demonſtration?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As to the Venome of Vegetals I ſaid ſufficient in the former Chapter, namely that there is no Vegetable ſo furious, ſo Venemons,
<note place="margin">☜</note> and deadly, but if decocted with a convenient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of an <hi>Alcaly,</hi> added to the moiſture, it is wholly corrected, as to the malignitie, although in ſome, a few offenfive Symptomes may remain, yet ſuch which Age will wholly by degrees, blot out and overcome.</p>
               <p>And here methinks I ſee ſome <hi>Tyrocyniſt</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing with <hi>Archimedes</hi> (I have found, I have found:) to whom I ſhall a little addreſs my ſpeech, with truth and caution,</p>
               <p>Firſt then, I ſay, for the incouragement of all young conſcionable practitioners, that this ſleight trivial preparation, exceeds the whole confuſed ſtock of preparations which adorn the <hi>Galeniſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> and that by many degrees, for by this means both the Crudities are overmaſtered, the gummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitle ſeparated, and the venome extinguiſhed, that ſo they of viſcous and malignantly poiſonous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come digeſted, ſaline, and friendly to Nature and to the <hi>Archeus</hi> of the Stomaek, and therefore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a better way diſcover it ſelf) I ſhall confidently adviſe this as a ſafe way to all beginners, who ſeek truth more then compliance with any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:51297:75"/>
               <p>But withall, let ſuch credit me, who will not knowingly deceive them, that this precocious way of preparation doth not fully anſwer the Artiſts deſire, nay contrariwiſe, it in many reſpects falls ſhort of it, for <hi>Alcalyes</hi> and <hi>Concrete Vegetables</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in Decoction they eaſily mixe, yet they do not ſo ſoon unite radically, that is, enter each others Center, or profunditie, which I ſhall make plain to the eies by an eaſie demonſtration, For let <hi>Opium</hi> or <hi>Aloes,</hi> or any other Concrete be Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xated by mean of <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and filtred never ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately, and then put into a Bottle, you ſhall find the ſides of the Glaſs and the Bottome fouled with a Viſcous Gummineſs and reſidence in a few weeks, a moſt evident ſign that the gummoſity was not totally maſtered and ſevered by that ſpeedy way of Elixation. Adde to this, that the <hi>Alcaly</hi> to the taſt retains its former lixiviateneſs, which it will not loſe till after a long time each working on the other, at laſt both will criſtallize in form of a Neuter Salt, far different from the ſharp lixiviate taſt of the firſt Alcaly, and till then you muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſome troubleſome Symptomes accompanying theſe preparations, which are to be attributed partly to Alcaly, whoſe corroſive lixiviateneſs is hoſtile to the Stomack in ſome degree, partly to the Concrete, whoſe <hi>Vita ultima</hi> not being wholly maſtered by this trivial preparation, no marvel if ſome offenſive qualities (which are the <hi>Tribuli</hi> and <hi>Spinae</hi> in Vegetal concretes) appear in their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Medicine.</p>
               <p>Which inconveniencies Art conſidering, and finding a tedious digeſtion the only remedie of them, ſtudiouſly ſought out a way of abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating this irkeſome time for its expectation,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51297:75"/>and by ingenuous waies performed it.</p>
               <p>For Liquid things attain their maturitie by long proceſs of time, (witneſs the making and ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Generous Wines, and ſtrong Beer) and they require alſo an excitation of an acid Ferment, which cauſeth a working Ebullition, which cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a more ſecret ſtill Ferment works inviſibly and imperceptibly, perfectly maturating, what the working boiling Ferment did but begin, and did onely in part, and ſo after a long time, the Wines become generous, ſparkling, lively, and Balſamical.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Alcalies</hi> are abſolutely repugnant to all aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and ſo no ſuch fermentation is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in them, and thence it is that Liquours prepared by means of them attain their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Energie in a farre more tedious time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by Arts Induſtrie that time be ſhortned.</p>
               <p>And truly this is the myſterie of true <hi>Pyrotechny</hi> to redeem time (then which man hath not a more pretious Iewel) which to perform is not eaſie for a Conceited putationer, or a perverſe Scioliſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then Nature in her daily operations, how by the viciſſitudes of Heat and Cold, Night and Day, Moiſture and Drineſs, ſhe brings the hardeſt Iron and Steel, the laſting Braſs, the durable Marble to a ſpontaneous corruption, by means of the Air, and Fire of Nature, which is the fermental virtue. Conſider how Ferments are proper to their own places, and where a cloſe,
<note place="margin">☞</note> and where an open dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is required, for a true Son of Art muſt know the due uſe of both <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Fire, Dryneſs</hi> and <hi>Moiſture, Cold</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> this is true <hi>Spagyrie,</hi> other curioſities are but idle Rapſodies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> therefore are to be corrected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51297:76"/>that they may correct other vegetable Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to be exalted in their own Natures, that ſo they may draw all other Tinctures to their own excellencie.</p>
               <p>For in their Simple fixed Nature they are of a Cauſtick fierie Lixiviate qualitie, which muſt be taken away, and the ſeminal balſamick vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which they want, muſt be ſuperadded, and their fixed corporietie overcome, that they may become Volatile.</p>
               <p>And here is to be obſerved that there is a great difference between <hi>Alcalies</hi> volatile, and volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as there is between diſtillable, or ſublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and diſtilled, or ſublimed, the one is in a capacitie of being volatized, the other actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> diſtilled, or made a Spirit, are advanced to the higheſt pitch of excellencie, to which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they are ordeined, and of this Spirit is that of <hi>Helmont</hi> to be underſtood, <hi>That wheree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it will not reach, nothing in the World can reach.</hi>

               <p>This Spirit is attainable by diverſe means, by ſome more, by ſome leſs in virtue and efficacie, Studie to attain this Spirit, next to the Great Solvent, if you would be maſter of noble medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Alcalies</hi> are volatized two waies, by Alcoolization, and by Elixeration: Pardon me Kind Reader, if I uſe the known Terms of Art, without which no Art is, and which cannot be put into plain Engliſh, without a tedious <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alcoolization is a feeding, or imbibing, or circulating a fixt Alcaly with a volatile Spirit,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51297:76"/>till both be made one, a neutrall production ariſing between them, diſtinct from each Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
               <p>And of this head there are three diſtinct kind of Spirits, <hi>Acetous, Vrinous,</hi> and <hi>Vinous,</hi> which give the <hi>Alcaly Alcoolizated,</hi> three diſtinct appellations, <hi>Arcanum Ponticitatis, Arcanum microcoſmi,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum Samech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Elixeration is performed by Oils eſſential, and Tinctures, until of both one <hi>Elixir,</hi> or <hi>Volatile Salt be made,</hi> of which are ſo many <hi>Species,</hi> as there are diverſities of Eſſentiall and Diſtilled Oils.</p>
               <p>Of theſe I ſhall here onely give a brief eſſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a more full handling of them, to a more convenient place.</p>
               <p>Of all the mentioned manners of operation, that which is done by an acetous Alcool, is the moſt facile, for ſuch a contrarietie there is between an <hi>Alcaly</hi> and an acid Spirit, that they meet not without a tumultuous ebullition, which by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ceaſeth, and when the Spirit, put on cauſeth no ebullition, it is a ſign the <hi>Alcaly</hi> is ſatiated.</p>
               <p>By mean of theſe Spirits the fixt <hi>Alcali</hi> loſeth its fiery corroſiveneſs and is made volatile, which an expert diſtiller ſhall find totally performed by rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate cohobation, which may rather be called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition, for that <hi>Alcaly</hi> which would no more of the ſpirit, but all ebullition at mixing thereof cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet if it be mingled with burntclay, and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in the manner of Spirit of Salt, or <hi>Nitre,</hi> till all that will diſtil over, be drawn of, the <hi>Caput mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> imbibe then with a new <hi>Alcool,</hi> which will take in new ſpirits, this do while it is a ſecond time
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51297:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſatiated, and diſtill it then with a very ſtrong fire, (at laſt,) repeat this operation till all the Salt be brought over (with the ſpirit) which will be then a moſt noble Spirit Alcalizate. This may be done with Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>Nitre,</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> of <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, &amp;c.</hi> or in ſhort, with any acid Spirit, and the Spirit thus attained may be called, <hi>Acetum forte, Acetum Radicis, &amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Paracelſus</hi> often names it.</p>
               <p>But as concerning many excellent preparations that may be made by Alcalies, they need not for them to be actually diſtilled, for that is a more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious work, it is ſufficient that they be only made volatile, that is, imbibed with a Spirit, till between them and the <hi>Alcaly,</hi> a neutral Salt be produced, an inſipid Flegme being only rejected, with this join the corrected Tincture of any Vegeral, and digeſt both together, till they criſtallize in the form of a Tincted Salt, having the <hi>Craſis</hi> of the Concrete.</p>
               <p>Yea, and the <hi>Alcali</hi> it ſelf by mixture with acid Spirits, as of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> of <hi>Nitre, Sulphur,</hi> or the like, yeelds noble abſterſive and diuretick medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, that with the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> (being known commonly by the name of <hi>Tartarum vitriolatum</hi>) if made truly (that is of pure <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> calcined <hi>perſe,</hi> by a Potters fire, and good ſpirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> poured on ſo long till the coullition ceaſe, then dried) it becomes a pleaſant ſweet medicine, very white in the doſe of 10, 15, or 20 <hi>gr.</hi> repeatted each morning, cleanſing the Stomack, reſolving power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſtructions in the <hi>Meſaraicks,</hi> and is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly given as an abſterſive, in <hi>ſevers, dgues, jaundite, ſcorb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51297:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>With Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> a like <hi>Salt</hi> is attained, but of an eaſier fuſion, taſting of a nitrous cool taſt, and is an excellent abſterſive in burning and putrid <hi>Fevers, gravel,</hi> heat of <hi>Vrine,</hi> ſharpneſs in the <hi>Stomach,</hi> uſually called <hi>Heart-burning,</hi> heat in the <hi>Back</hi> and <hi>Kidneys,</hi> heat in the <hi>Stomach,</hi> cauſing a hot and harſh breath, and many other defects that are ſeated in the firſt and ſecond digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>And ſo with Spirit of <hi>Sulphur, Salt, &amp;c.</hi> very noble preparations may be made, but much more noble, if the purified tinctures of noble <hi>Vegetals</hi> (their malignity being firſt corrected) be united with this <hi>Salt</hi> in a due proportion (the <hi>Salt</hi> being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſied in a convenient Liquour;) digeſt then the <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Tincture,</hi> til both become very cleer, for at firſt mixing they will be muddy, and precipitating a light <hi>Faecula,</hi> will at laſt be very cleer, decant this cleer Liquour that is tincted, and in a ſlow fire draw away the moiſture, till the known ſign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and in a cool place it will chriſtallize into a pure <hi>Salt</hi> tincted, with the true tincture of the <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> retaining its taſt, odour, and virtue.</p>
               <p>Thus out of <hi>Hellebore</hi> black or white, <hi>Opium</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Simple, that will yeeld a tincture in Spirit of Wine, a Salt may be made, which then is called by the name of the Vegetal with which it is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as Salt of Hellebore, of Opium, of Zalap, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Salts beſides the abſterſive virtue of the <hi>Salt,</hi> have a ſuperadded Specification, according to the intention of the <hi>Concrete,</hi> by which a ſedulous, and induſtrious Phyſician, may with Gods bleſſing, cute many and thoſe deplorable diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>But this way of making Salts, is inferiour to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparations, to which I ſhall come in order,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51297:78"/>eſpecially ſuch as are made with Vineger (its ſpirit to wit) which becomes what it is, only by extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vinous Balſome, and ſo the acidity (which moderate cauſed fermentation) by being over exalted, deſtroies the ſame, and makes the body of the Wine become Pontique, corroſive, and ungrateful to Nature, only moderately uſed, it whets the appetite, and ſo excitatively promotes digeſtion of groſs meats, as Beef (eſpecially cold and fat) or of raw crude meats, as Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, and the ſpirits of <hi>Nitre, Salt, Vitriol, &amp;c.</hi> being diſtilled by a violent fire, although they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come corroſive and abſterſive, yet they have in them no ſeminal balſamick virtue, nor in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive nature are they altogether excuſable from offence to the Stomack, for although their acidity aſſwage thirſt, yet this aciditie differs much from the aciditie of the Stomack, which is fermental, and therfore it behoves it to be changed by it, into its own nature, which how difficult it is, let Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers judge, for the aciditie of the Stomack to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the Lixiviateneſs of an <hi>Alealy,</hi> is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if the <hi>Alcaly</hi> do not overpower it, with too much quantitie, ſince the antipathie between an Alcalizateneſs and all acidities is ſo apparent to the eye, ſo that the ſuperfluous aciditie of the ſtomack may ſatiate a convenſent doſe of an <hi>Alcali</hi> (which it ſhall receive in) without trouble or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to it ſelf, and may do this daily (with very good ſucceſs, where the aciditie of the Stomack is too abundant, and the <hi>Alcaly</hi> thus ſatiate, becomes mild, and ſo tempering it ſelf with the reſidue of the acid Chyle, may paſs to the ſecond digeſtion, where it is clethed with a Saline habit, but for an
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51297:78"/>aciditie to work upon an aciditie, is as improbable as for one <hi>Alcaly</hi> to work on another, and for the ſtomachical aciditie, to endure a mineral aciditie (unſatiated) were to imagine, that Nature had no diſcretion. This for a caution to thoſe who are too tampering with acid (eſpecially corroſive) ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, let them be ſure to give them at ſuch a time, when there are <hi>Faeces abſtergendae in primis vaſibus,</hi> as about the mouth of the Stomack, the root of the tongue, the throat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then give them in a competent doſe, and laſtly continue them not too long, unleſs in a very diſcreet doſe: Hence it was that the wiſe and noble <hi>Helmont,</hi> in his Tractate concerning the Tree of Life, tells a memorable ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of one that he adviſed to uſe the true cleer lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſpirit of <hi>Sulphur</hi> (not that tincted baſe adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſpirit, perfidiouſly made, and villanouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſale to the ignorant Apothecaries, by our apoſtate raſcal Chemiſts, which ſwarm now almoſt every where) and to take, before each mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or at each meal, in his firſt drink, two drops of that Spirit, and charged him not to be too overventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to exceed that doſe, as well knowing, that ſuch a doſe daily was enough, by its aciditie to cleanſe the accidental Sordes, adhering to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, which hindred digeſtion, and by its Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Gas</hi> to keep the meat and drink taken in, from putrefactive corruption, by which means the Patient (being careful to follow this grave advice) lived to a very great age, to wit forty years after this aduice given, being then fiftie eight years old, and which was very remarkable, in all that forty yeers was never troubled with the leaſt Feveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although once by fall on the Ice he broke his Legge, let the ſtudious Reader conſider the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51297:79"/>ſo as to profit by it. Conſider then ſeriouſly your intention, and ſo apply your remedies, which if they be not as you would have them, you muſt by Art make them ſo, or confeſs your ſelf to be no Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>All acidities, as acidities, are corroſive and fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting more or leſs, (witneſs <hi>Crabſeies</hi> in the leaſt acid white or Rheniſh Wine) but no acidity in the world out of the Stomack is comparably the ſame with the ſtomachical aciditie, which is a peerleſs Creature, variated in every ſeveral Species of Animalls, and is an unſeparable Companion of the life.</p>
               <p>Now moſt acidities (nay all that have nothing of Venemous qualities admixed) help the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, in as much as they are abſterſive, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome <hi>foeces</hi> Which affect, and afflict (that is obſtruct and hinder) the activity of the firſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, whether as to the appetible, or digeſtible facultie.</p>
               <p>Of acidities alſo are various kinds, ſome which ſpontaneouſly are changed by being dried, as the render leaves of <hi>Grapes, young Grapes, &amp;c.</hi> others by digeſtion, as the juice of <hi>Lemmons,</hi> and <hi>Orenges,</hi> others by a light operation on a proper object, as Whitewine on <hi>Crabſeies,</hi> and therefore experience hath taught us to cat <hi>Lemmons,</hi> and drink White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine with <hi>Sugar,</hi> on which acting, in the pepantick digeſtion of the Stomack, they become cooling, abſterſive and diuretick.</p>
               <p>But the aciditie of <hi>Vineger,</hi> being a product out of Wine over eager or fretted, is of a more reſiſting Nature to the Stomack, by how much it is eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Wine (that is a refreſher of the ſame) and therefore if made in <hi>Syrup</hi> with <hi>Sugar,</hi> in no large
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51297:79"/>doſe, in ſome cauſeth vomit, yet for ſtrong conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions with ſtrong meats, as roaſt Beef, or boild, Souſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is a wholſome ſauce, by ſome acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with muſtardſeed; where note, that ſo much groſs meat or green herbes (which are raw and crude) are eaten with it, as will imploy its whole aciditie in fretting them, and preparing them for the ſtomachical Ferment, which then the Stomack digeſts together with the meat, as being afterward no more acid, and ſo no way reſiſting its fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal aciditie.</p>
               <p>But as for Mineral acidities, and other products of the fire of Reverberation, and which are as burning as Fire, as (to wit) the Spirits of <hi>Vitriol, Sulphur, Sea-ſalt, Nitre, Salt-gem, &amp;c.</hi> thoſe which are minetal want not their deſerved ſuſpition of Arſenical malignitie, and ſo are to be uſed cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with diſcretion, elſe invenomed <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Vitriol</hi> with an Arſenical commixture, will not onely fruſtrate the expected hope of help from their Spirits, but alſo hurt the Patient to the Phyſicians juſt and deſerved Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Now as for the acid ſpirits of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or <hi>Seaſalt,</hi> of all others they are the moſt cleer from ſuſpition of their danger as to virulencie: let him that uſeth them attend both the doſe and the times of repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doſe, that would uſe them honeſtly and commendably.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the abſterſive nature of acid Spirits, with ſome neceſſary Cautions concerning their uſe. Now we ſhall adde a little, as to <hi>Alcalies,</hi> in their Corroſive lixiviate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that from the view of Both, as they are alone, and of themſelves, we may make a third Neutral
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51297:80"/>product, yet partaking the abſterſive Nature of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> we ſay then, are of an abſterſive Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſaline, but hoſtile to the Stomack as lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate, or calcineous, the reaſon is obvious to a weak eye, becauſe of the contrarictie (pardon my expreſſion) which is evident between lixiviate, and acid qualities, which if both be in an high degree they reſiſt even to an actual flagration (as appears in ſlacking of quick Lime, and alſo in the mixture of ſtrong Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> with a well calcined Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi>) however the leaſt perceptible aciditie, cannot meet with the leaſt actual or potential lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate <hi>Alcaly,</hi> but there is ſtraight a tumultuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance made of each to other, as is apparent in any Alcalizate <hi>Salt</hi> and <hi>Vinegar,</hi> or in the leaſt ſoure <hi>Vineger,</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> and powder'd <hi>Crabſeies,</hi> nor is there any end of this conteſt, till either the acid or lixiviate qualitie, or both, be mortified, that is ſatiated, and ſo extinguiſhed, unleſs the two oppoſite ſubſtances ſo meet, that one overpowers the other, and then it forceth the other to ſubmit to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that where the ferment of the ſtomack is only ſtrong enough (which ferment to be an aciditie we have before ſhewed more than once) there it muſt needs debilitate the appetible, and digeſtive faculties, (both of them while they are taken) and this debilitation in a very weak Stomack, may prove an extinction for a time, which is an effect not commendable nor deſire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Hence it follows, that onely where a ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous acor is in the ſtomack, there the application of <hi>Alcalies</hi> in their proper Nature is excuſable,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51297:80"/>otherwiſe it muſt make an alienation (at leaſt) if nor a peſſumdation of the appetite, and digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are both excited and performed by aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, to which an <hi>Alcaly</hi> in its Nature is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinct.</p>
               <p>So then although we deny not, that both <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> and acid Spirits are abſterſive, and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble medicaments in their proper place, applied in due caſes with due caution, and deliberate judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both as to time and doſe, yet becauſe there are many caſes in which both of them may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, and do actual hurt, the one in reference to its corroſive aciditie, the other to its lixiviate Cauſtick hoſtilitie, we affirme and lay down for undeniable, theſe few poſitions concerning them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the virtue that is in theſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Salts or Spirits, conſiſts not in the Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or Cauſtick qualities, but that theſe are onely impreſſions of the fire on the Subjects, and may be taken away without doing the Spirits or Salts any harme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the operations they performe, which are Medicinal, and for the opening ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, they performe far more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when dulcified, than while retaining their Ponticitie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That both the Acidities, and the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi> being the products of extreme fire, have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them any ſeminal <hi>Craſis</hi> in them, but act the volatile aciditie, as a mineral acetouſneſs, not attained but by the extreme fire of Reverberation, the fixt lixiviate Salt, as it is a Salt, and purified by the violent action of the Fire.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Then theſe being joined together,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51297:81"/>produce a mild temperate Salt, cooling cleanſing, and opening obſtructions in the <hi>Stomack, Pylorus,</hi> and <hi>Meſaraicks,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, That being dulcified, ſuch a doſe may be given of them without any offence, nay rather with much refreſhment to the Patient, of which a third part in the priſtine Nature of each, could nor be given without offence at leaſt, if not danger.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, I ſhall adde that what ever Tincture of any Vegetable (being firſt prepared, corrected, and purified) is joined with this Salt, and duly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ordered with it, it will chriſtallize toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it into a pure Salt, having the odour, taſt, and ſmell, the virtues alſo and efficacie of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Concrete.</p>
               <p>To conclude then this Subject, let me give the Reader a taſt of what benefit he may reap by theſe preparations.</p>
               <p>He ſhal have mineral and acid Spirits dulcified, Corroſive Salts made mild, that ſo being friendly to Nature, they may have entrance to the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, <hi>Pylorus,</hi> and <hi>Mefaraicks,</hi> where becoming Diuretick, they reſolve and bring away all obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or Coagulations which they can Maſter, and what they cannot ſingly performe, by addition of ſeveral Species, which according to their kindes are made one Salt, together with them it may be performed.</p>
               <p>For, the forenamed Salts as they are ſingly dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, have no ſeminal or proper determination of their virtue, but are indefinitely abſterſive, and deoppilative, in the waies through which they paſs, which virtue is determinated to operate on the head, by the addition of Cephalick Simples,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51297:81"/>which it doth ſalificate, that is, makes their (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe clammy) tinctures, to become faline, and to chriſtallize, and ſo by addition of any other ſimple Concretes, different ſpecificated Salts may be had, as many and as diverſe, as there are ſorts of Concretes to be gotten or procured.</p>
               <p>But theſe preparations (though much nobler then the Galenical Conſerves, or Syrups, or Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died things which are done with Sugar, are yet inferiour to thoſe preparations which are made by Elixeration of <hi>Tartar</hi> with eſſential Oiles, and Spiritualized Tinctures, or brought into a Samech, with pure rectified Spirit of Wine.</p>
               <p>For by means of theſe the Salt is made not only volatile and ſweet, and ſo it becomes inoffenſively abſterſive and penetrative, but it is alſo endowed with balſamick and aromatick qualities, and ſo doth not ſalificate only the Tinctures,
<note place="margin">☜</note> that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it, but alſo ſpiritualizeth them, for in the Salt which is made by acid Spirits, and an <hi>Alcalie,</hi> although Tinctures by it are criſtallized, &amp; made Salt, yet are they not ſo ſpiritualized, as to be free from future Empyrheumes, as in theſe other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations they are. So Sugar is criſtallized, and reiterately refined, yet will it burne, and be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heterogeneities, foul, filthie and ſtinking, by the fire.</p>
               <p>Tis true that <hi>Alcalies</hi> by Acid Spirits, if they, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatiated, are after diſtilled, by cohobation are volatized; but this Spirit which is thus gotten, is acid, as other Spirits, diſtilled with a ſtrong fire, are, although it be very penetrative, and diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mettals, and being by them turned into a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile coagulated Salt, be of a moſt admirable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacie in Medicine, yet the Salt when

               <p>But <hi>Alcalies</hi> and <hi>Oils eſſential</hi> and burning ſpirits are radically of kin each to other, and ſo the <hi>Alcaly</hi> by them recovers what it loſt by burning, that is a ſeminal, vital, eſſential Balſom, and ſo becomes not only volatile, but fermental and exceeding ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable to our Nature, and ſo an admirable mean of preparing &amp; advancing noble Vegetals, thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which are odorous, balſamick, and aethereal.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall before I paſs, anſwer two obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which captious Spirits may make, the one oppoſing my Doctrine to noble <hi>Helmont,</hi> the other oppoſing me to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>For the firſt they will object <hi>Helmonts</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>That volatile Spirits</hi> (as of Wine, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) <hi>are fixed by means of fixt Salts,</hi> whereas I affirme, That the Salts by their Spirits are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latized.</p>
               <p>To which I ſhall anſwer. That both are true, for the ſpirit is upon the <hi>Alcali</hi> robd of its ſaline parts, rejecting the reſidue in forme of an inſipid aquous flegme: Thus is the Spirit (as to the Saline part
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51297:83"/>of it) fixed, in reſpect of what it was, yet not ſo fixed, but that by fire it will be made to diſtill over into a Recipient, which a fixt <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly</hi> alone would never doe, ſo that the <hi>Alcaly</hi> is made more Volatile, and the Spirit more fixt than before.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Helmont</hi> ſpeaking of this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his Tractate concerning the <hi>Duelech,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a Spirit acting on a Body in a Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive way is in a manner fixed</hi> (quodammodo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xatur) <hi>being ſo fixed, that it will abide a great heat to what it would before,</hi> thus Spirit of Wine which was extremely Volatile, ſo as to flie with the leaſt heat, becomes (as to its Saline part) ſo fixt, that it will not flie but in a heat equal to the Diſtillation of <hi>Aqua For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> which may (and not unworthily) be called a Fixation.</p>
               <p>But beſides there is a great myſterie in theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, which will be more conveniently tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the anſwer to the other objection, which I ſhall therefore make, that in the anſwer to it, full ſatisfaction may be given to an Ingenuous Reader.</p>
               <p>The Objection then is of ſuch who would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me to my ſelf, Firſt in that I ſay that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Volatile Alcalies is not Acid, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct to Aciditie, whereas in another place I affirme of a Volatile Spirit of <hi>Tartar</hi> that it is Acid, as all Spirits drawn by the fire are. And Secondly, That in my firſt Tractate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled Natures Explication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I writing of Alcalies Elixerated by Oiles Eſſential, affirmed them to be the moſt ſlow for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Efficacie of all Preparations, by
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51297:84"/>which <hi>Alcalies</hi> are volatized, whereas in this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate I affirme, That <hi>Alcalies</hi> by Elixeration with Oiles, or by reduction to a Samech, by rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits, are the moſt noble as to Vegetal prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>To which Objection, in both parts of it, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as I did to the former, that both are very true; only it behoves the careful Reader to conſider in what reſpect the one and the other may be affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>To anſwer then the laſt part of the Objection firſt, I ſay ſtill, that Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> (if elixerated with an eſſential Oil) becomes a very noble Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but as to its virtue, as an active diſſolving <hi>menſtrue,</hi> it is of all other the moſt ſluggiſh, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Helmonts</hi> moſt true obſervation, <hi>Ex ſalibus illa languidiora reperi, quae ſequebantur Sulphurum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapiam.</hi> So Spirit of Wine is nothing ſo diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>menſtrue</hi> as Spirit of Vineger, eſpecially for mettalline Bodies, but nothing comparable to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua fortis,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or the like. It is one thing to be a menſtrue for mettalline bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and a far different thing to be a noble <hi>medium</hi> to volatize and exalt vegetal Tinctures, which want a fermental exaltation of their Natures, much more than a Corroſive ſharpneſs to open their bodies: each then are of uſe in their own way and kind.</p>
               <p>But beſides, The queſtion is concerning <hi>Alcalies</hi> edulcorated, and made volatile, not actually vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and here we muſt yeeld the Garland to elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated Salts, eſpecially to ſuch which are exalted into a <hi>Samech,</hi> for they have their ſeminal Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mick Virtue reſtored to them, of which the other are deprived by burning of the fire, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51297:84"/>by addition of acid Corroſive Spirits, which wanting it themſelves, cannot give what they have not.</p>
               <p>Theſe then meeting with Vegetal Tinctures, become Fermental each to other, and advance each other into a true eſſential Balſom, which is of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Virtue.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the aciditie of ſome Alcali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zate Spirits, and the non aciditie of others, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference therein lies in the preparation of, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon them, and according to the variety u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed herein, various products appear, and are brought to light: for the Philoſopher is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental helper of, and cooperator with Nature, and the Fire is an inſtrumental help to the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</p>
               <p>Happy is that Philoſopher, that ſhall make his preparations ſo, that a gentle heat may make the <hi>Alcalies</hi> to flie, he (without jeſting) may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Natures choiceſt ſecrets: but if he muſt be inforced to uſe the help of the extreameſt heat, that will ſtamp a fierie Impreſſion on the produced Spirit; and ſo are the Objections anſwered.</p>
               <p>However to ſatisfie the ſtudious Reader, I ſhall adde, that the Spirit attained by means of Pontique Spirits, will be acid and pontique, and thoſe obteined by mean of eſſential Oiles, which are Vegetal <hi>Sulphurs</hi> and rectified ſpirits of Wine, which are but <hi>Sulphurs</hi> in a diſguiſe, (witneſs the inflamableneſs of them) will not be acid: and therefore <hi>Helmont</hi> reckoning up the Spirits of all Salts, concludes them acid, <hi>Exceptis Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calizatis, &amp; Sulphurum eſsentialium in Vegetabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:51297:85"/>
               <p>Now to proceed to the Operations on Salts by means of eſſential Oiles, and Alcoolizate Spirit of wine, that ſo I may draw to a Concluſion of this diſcourſe, having firſt fully ſatisfied the ſtudious Reader.</p>
               <p>I join the Elixeration with Oils, with the making it into a <hi>Samech,</hi> with Spirits, as being much of one nature, and the one way convertible into the other by the Artiſts craft and induſtrie.</p>
               <p>For eſſential oiles and burning Spirits are but the ſame thing in a various diſguiſe, and both of them are hard to be reconciled with fixed Salts.</p>
               <p>Concerning eſſential Oiles and Salts, <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith expreſsly and truly, <hi>That if they be joined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any water, within three months time (occulta &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta circulatione) they will all be turned into a volatile Salt,</hi> and of Spirit of Wine he ſaith, <hi>That Salt of Tartar by its bare touch doth turn one half of it into water</hi> (robbing it of its volatile Saltneſs, and fixing that upon it ſelf, with a kind of fixity) but in both, there is ſomething ſufficiently obſcure, nor eaſily to be underſtood; For firſt of all, in the Elixeration of Oiles and Alcalies, the <hi>pondus</hi> is not ſet down, and the time is tedious (<hi>viz.</hi> three months) which if a man ſhould expect and miſs, he hath no comfort but to think that he erred in <hi>Helmonts</hi> (hidden and ſecret) digeſtion, which will prove (like the Alche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts peck of Coles) but a cold comfort. So alſo in the operation on Salt of Tartar, with moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flegmed Spirit of Wine, true, the Salt by its bare touch will ſo tranſmute it, but how to make them touch, that is the difficultie, For pure <hi>Salt,</hi> in pure ſpirit of wine, ſinks to the bottome like ſand in fair and common water, nor will they touch each other
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51297:85"/>that is be mingled one with the other, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel than if ſeveral Scioliſts have complained of the tediouſneſs of this operation, that in threeſcore rectifications they could not perfect the <hi>Balſamum Samech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For put caſe the Spirit of Wine be not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, the Salt attracts its aquoſitie, and ſo helps to deflegme it exquiſitely, but doth not rob it at all, whereas if the Spirit be exquiſitely deflegmed, it toucheth not the Salt at all, nor will ſixe diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations reiterated rob it one ounce, much leſs one half, becauſe there is no union, nay no mixture, and where that is not, there can be no action nor paſſion.</p>
               <p>And here my tired Coleburners are in a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, becauſe they know not the mean of conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is not any ſuperadditional Subſtance to the matter, but only <hi>modus diſpoſitionis</hi> of which if any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</p>
               <p>Phie, fond pretenders, to that in which you are but Bunglers: doe you not ſee the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, how by a mean they viſit, and make fruitful earthly bodies: for ſhame learne to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate Nature in her moſt ordinarie operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alcalies</hi> then with eſſential oils are to be joined, that both may make a <hi>Sapo</hi> together, and then time by a ſecret fermental decoction will tranſmute each into a third neuter, made of both, which is a volatile <hi>Elixar,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>Alcalies</hi> and pure Spirits are to be joined together, that one may ſeem to eat up the other, and then this touch will be like the clut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of a theef, whoſe hands are bands, elſe no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, no union, and by conſequence no operation each on other. (<hi>N.B.</hi>)</p>
               <p>And indeed this, and this onely is the Gordian
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51297:86"/>knot that puzzles, and for ever will puzzle the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſond Alchemiſts, they know not the true means, to reconcile extremes, but fancie new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick ſubſtances, not knowing the myſterie of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual love (an inſeparable concomitant of true life) how that it is never without bodies, but alwaies follows its own bodies due diſpoſition, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is our hidden name, our <hi>diploma,</hi> our my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie incommunicable, but the guift of God to whom, and when he pleaſeth, To him be all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory, and everlaſting Benediction.</p>
               <p>O fooliſh Operatours! that by your deviſed heats, would draw down celeſtial influences, and introduce ferments (the true parents of all formes) and yet know not by any of your heats to imitate the Sun in the <hi>Bermuda</hi> in producing <hi>Oranges</hi> or <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:</hi> Ceaſe ſond Artiſts, and let me the meaneſt of Philoſophers (yet one truly regenerated by the fire) inſtruct you better, and pray to him who above all is the great Maſter (whom no Scholler yet went beyond) that he would be your guide and director, for here (to deal ingenuouſly) my ſpeech is miſty and very obſcure.</p>
               <p>Let <hi>Alcalies</hi> and <hi>Oiles</hi> purely prepared, embrace each other in the bond of Love, which will appear in a kind of an urinous ſcent, and a ſaponary mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which will be white and thick like <hi>Cream,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your decoction, till your mixture end in an union, and the Oil and Salt be both diſſolvable without the leaſt oilineſs ſwimming at top, this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution make with Spirit of Wine, which will mixe (doubt it not) the Oil and the Salt being once ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, and inſeparably united.</p>
               <p>This Solution in a due heat rectifie, and you ſhall have a volatile burning Spirit, of the odour
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51297:86"/>and taſt of the Oil, and after it an inſipid flegme, and at bottome a noble tincted balſamick <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The volatile Spirit deflegme exquiſitely, and then unite it to the remaining balſom, and digeſt them together, till the Spirit be made one with the more fixed balſom, howbeit reſt aſſured that both are volatile.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which that you may advance, yet more and more in virtue, according to the qualitie of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Oil, cauſe this Balſom to drie,
<note place="margin">☜</note> and criſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize without any extraneous addition of ſubſtance or ſeparative culinary heat, then will this criſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Salt (like an infant that is hungry) feed on, and in ſhort time tranſmute into its own nature, any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Oil, or if you pleaſe rather, the ſame with which it was at the firſt produced.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Feed it then, till it have at laſt eaten up thrice as much of the eſſential Oil as was of the Alcalizate Salt, in which feeding, let there be a ſucceſſion of Humectation and Exſiccation, of cold and heat, the exſiccation and cold,
<note place="margin">☜</note> the Air will give (underſtood Philoſophically) the humectation and heat, the fire will give (underſtood not vulgarly) which are the main wheels, by which nature Circulates all, yea the hardeſt things, in the great World, to a tranſmutation, underſtand this, and neither the Secret of the <hi>Alchaheſt,</hi> nor the myſteries of the Sun, and Mercurie will be hidden from thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou ſeeſt Reader, how preſuming upon thy capacity, I have tranſgreſſed neer hand in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Candour towards thee, I have (as it were) met thee half way, and brought great ſecrets home to thy door, in a manner half naked, and yet rouſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51297:87"/>up thy attention, and have a little more patience, and I will proceed yet further in my Candidneſs, which I have already begun.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt ſeen the <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and the Oil, their mixture, digeſtion. union, and feeding, until they come to ſuch a proportion of the volatile to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulated and united, upon and with the fixed, that both by this means may become volatile, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual together.</p>
               <p>Therefore as becomes a true Philoſopher, give them fire, and in a due heat make them flie, which if they do not eaſily enough to thy mind, imbibe them (and drie them by a flow digeſtion as before) with a convenient Liquour, as for inſtance good wine, or ſpirits, on which it feeds and grows each circulation more and more volatile and ſpiritual, till at laſt it will ſublime in a gentle heat of Sand, in the forme of a glorified Salt, then which the kingdom of the Vegetables hath not a more noble medicine.</p>
               <p>For the making of Samech, let pure Spirit of Wine, and pure Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> (without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing, ſave only the addition of true ſpiritual love which is the <hi>aethereal</hi> fire, the ſecret fire, and the true and only exciter of the Ferment) be joined, and ſo digeſted, and in few daies moſt part of the Spirit will be retained in the Salt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Flegme carefully and diſcreetly, and renew your Spirit as much as it loſt (you may put on each time of the Spirit four times the weight of the Salt) thus in four or five reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (or ſixe you may make if you pleaſe) you ſhall have a balſome tincted like a pure Ruby, of a grateful taſt and ſmell, which is a <hi>noble medicament,</hi> called by <hi>Helmont</hi> the <hi>Balſamus,</hi> or the <hi>Arcanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſamech.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:51297:87"/>
               <p>Proceed to the higheſt exaltation of it thus, Let this Balſom,
<note place="margin">☜</note> without any extraneous addition to its ſubſtance be dried, without any vaporous heat of Vulcan, then will it like a living child, thirſt for its own food, which give it by ſeveral and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate imbibitions, till this wheel have been ſeven times turned round upon it, then make it flie in a modeſt heat of Sand, and it will be a moſt noble balſamick eſſential ſalt, which is as to medicinal uſe <hi>Alcalium apex,</hi> and may worthily be reputed <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici Corona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This operation you ſee hath great affinity with the foretaught way of Elixeration, by eſſential Oiles, now I ſhall teach the Coincidency of theſe two waies, and both Mineral and Vegetable additions to them, by which they are ennobled beyond what can be beleeved by him that hath not tried.</p>

               <p>This Medicine is univerſal, and wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative, curing all diſeaſes powerfully <hi>in tono uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſono,</hi> a little inferiour, but a noble <hi>Succedaneum</hi> to the grand <hi>Arcana,</hi> which require an Alchaheſtical preparation.</p>
               <p>This Operation, is very tedious to bring it to this height, but being ſo advanced, it is a middle way to prepare the <hi>Eſſentia membrorum,</hi> and <hi>Vinum vitae</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> which (out of the <hi>Metallus maſculus,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, or out of <hi>Antimony</hi>) beſides its incredible cures by it performable, it reſtores the body of man wonderfully, renewing really the <hi>hair, teeth,</hi> and <hi>skin,</hi> which <hi>Medea</hi> was fabled, to have performed for her Father in law old <hi>Aeſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if your leaſure or opportunity will not give you leave to advance theſe <hi>Medicaments</hi> to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned height, yet at leaſt bring them to an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir,</hi> and rectifie this in pure ſpirit of wine Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, either with <hi>Cinamon,</hi> or <hi>Cloves,</hi> or <hi>Cardamom, &amp;c.</hi> deflegming both the <hi>Ruby,</hi> (or rather bloud) red <hi>Balſom</hi> or <hi>Samech,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> then reunite the <hi>Spirit</hi> thus deflegmed, and its <hi>Samech,</hi> and decoct them till they become inſeparable, ſo is the <hi>Mineral Faetor</hi> changed into an <hi>Aromatick fragrancy,</hi> and I will aſſure you a <hi>Medicine</hi> on which you may relie with confidence, for the cure of all (unleſs the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt graduated, or obſtinately <hi>Chronical,</hi> hereditary) diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Come we now to apply our <hi>Elixerated Samech,</hi> for I ſhall be cafter unite them, ſince experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51297:89"/>us, that theſe two waies, will ſo eaſily and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably marry each other) to the preparing, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and ſpiritualizing noble Vegetal tinctures, which are of excellent efficacy, and make the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> by many degrees more powerful then it was before, when (to deal candidly) it was of moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable efficacy.</p>
               <p>And here Reader take my counſel, let the <hi>Baſis</hi> of thy <hi>Elixir</hi> be Oil of <hi>Therebinth,</hi> which I elſewhere call <hi>Oleum perpetuè virentis,</hi> for which take theſe few, but not trivial reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The tree is perpetually green, yea in the moſt exquiſite froſts, the trees growing in the cold frozen Regions, as <hi>Ruſsia, Newfound land, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, For moſt part growes on high, and barren ſandy grounds, yet runs ſo much of that fat, that had it not vent, the Tree for farneſs would be choaked.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Oil is fragrant, admirably <hi>Diuretick</hi> and excellently <hi>Abſterſive,</hi> and <hi>healing</hi> both inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly, and in <hi>Conorrheas,</hi> and ſcalding <hi>Vrines</hi> got on a <hi>Venereal</hi> ſcore, it hath not its peer in the Vegetal family.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The tree is not much unlike the <hi>Cedar,</hi> and is a wood of long duration, if kept dry.</p>
               <p>Whence it may be gathered, that the <hi>Oil</hi> beſides a <hi>diuretick</hi> and <hi>healing</hi> quality, doth alſo promiſe, at leaſt gives hopes (on probable conjectures) of long life, and of amending the conſtitution, bringing it to a virid flouriſhing temper, of youth and ſtrength and vindicating it from the cold declining Winter, of waſting old Age.</p>
               <p>But laſtly, It is to be had in large quantities, without the leaſt fear of adulteration (its price being ſecurity ſufficient, for its unmixt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity)
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51297:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſo ſeems to be deſtinated by God (the father of the poor) for the comfort of poor people, to whoſe releef being elixerated alone, it may be applied an hundred waies with excellent ſucceſs, but with far more, if firſt diſtilled with a mineral <hi>Sulphur,</hi> till both by oft cohobation be married in a volatile Oil, this then elixerated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with Spirit of Wine, and with it rectified, til it loſe its <hi>faetor,</hi> and then both Spirit and tincted bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom make one <hi>Elixir,</hi> this ſalificated, and fed with Spirit of Wine (inriched with Aromatical Spirits) till it be fully ſatiated, then ſublimed (as was taught more at large before) or if not ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but kept in a fragrant elixerated <hi>Samech,</hi> it will be of admirable virtue and eſſicacie, or if it be married with prepared Tinctures of noble Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, thus,</p>
               <p>This <hi>Alcaly</hi> thus elixerated, with twice or thrice as much Oil of <hi>Therebinth,</hi> till both Salt and Oil will diſſolve inſeparably in Spirit of Wine, this Spirit let it be inriched, with diſtilling it from <hi>Cinamon,</hi> and with it diſſolve your <hi>Elixir,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill the volatile Spirit from the Balſamick (ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-coloured) <hi>Samech,</hi> dephlegme both, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite them.</p>
               <p>Then have ready ſome noble Vegetal Tincture, which for example ſake, I ſhall inſtance in <hi>Myrrhe, Aloes,</hi> and <hi>Saffron,</hi> and of them make an <hi>Elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis Samech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Species</hi> beaten up and mixed with equal part of pure Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> are by an artificial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion ſo macerated, that they will yeeld their full Tincture, prepared, corrected, and advanced, this Tincture then extracted with pure Spirit of Wine, inriched by reiterate diſtillation with ſpirit of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namom,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51297:90"/>this then added to the former elixerated <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech,</hi> the Spirit abſtracted (which will be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fragrant) both the balſamick <hi>Elixir</hi> and the Spirit being purely dephlegmed, both are then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conjoined, and by a ſecret digeſtion made all one inſeparably, that is, the <hi>Samech,</hi> the fragrant Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Tincture, which all make a (balſamick <hi>Sameth Elixiris proprietatis</hi>) very fragrant, and which I am conſident comes no way ſhort of, if it exceed not, the way of the Alchaneſtical preparation: Wonder not at it, Courteous Reader, God hath given to each man his Talent: Although <hi>Helmont</hi> knew the <hi>Samech, &amp;c.</hi> excellently well, yet this way of applying it to Vegetals, I am almoſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he never knew, he had his convenienty for other operations, but being through the good hand of God deprived of conveniency for ſome other operations, which I rather intended, and deſired, could I have gotten convenient opportunitie, that is in plain termes, wanting conveniencie to diſtill the volatile Spirit of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> for mineral operations (of which in the ſecond Chapter of this laſt part I gave a full ſatisfactory account) which I had tried in ſmall quantities, ſo as to know them, but wanted convenient furnaces, and room to diſtill that Spirit in great quantity, I hating I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleneſs, endeavoured <hi>Exornare Spartam meam,</hi> to my utmoſt, and ſo tried the utmoſt of <hi>Alcalies;</hi> and eſſential Oils, and burning Spirits, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Balſamick, and Vegetal, and ſo Fermental would be brought to their higheſt pitch of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, with a far inferiour degree of heat than would be required for the other, this therefore I did proſecute diligently and ſtudiouſly, and (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) found my ſtudies, watchings, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51297:91"/>crowned with ſucceſs, as I have given you a can did deſcription largely, and ſufficiently plain, in the foregoing diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>But to return to this <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> it is made of <hi>Helmonts</hi> ingredients, diſſolved with a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient mean, and ſo prepared, elixerated, and brought to a tincture, and then inſeparably marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Arcanum Samech,</hi> which is of it ſelf a thrice noble medicament.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Helmont</hi> ſpeaking of his <hi>media Via</hi> to make the <hi>Elixir proprietatis,</hi> which is, to be performed by bare digeſtion, of the three <hi>Species,</hi> an Ounce preciſely of each, well beaten and mingled together, in a large Glaſs, with a convenient heat, addes, That if the <hi>Species</hi> be united with a <hi>Medium,</hi> the product will be of no worth; He ſpeaketh that, in reference to <hi>Crollius,</hi> and others, deſcription of the <hi>Elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis,</hi> according to their Phantaſie, one uſing the <hi>Medium</hi> of Spirit of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> another, another thing, or two. But my way is by a mean not Corroſive, but familiar to the Vegetal Nature, the nobleſt of all fixed Salts dulcified, and made Balſamical, and of a ſeminal Virtue, by its own Volatile Spirit, which is ſo noble, that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls it his <hi>Circulatum minus,</hi> by which the three <hi>Species</hi> are opened, volatized, and made Spiritual, ſo that beſide the fragrant ſpirit, there is alſo the ſubſtantial tincture which is not of a contemptible virtue, and all joined with ſuch a Salt, which is friendly to Nature, and (by reaſon of its Volatile Nature) penetrative even to the very entrance of the fourth digeſtion, and by reaſon of its Alcalizate Nature, it is marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly abſterſive, reſolving all muccous foulneſs,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51297:91"/>and cutting and attenuating all tough flegmatick coagulations, which it finds in its paſſage, bringing them forth by Vrine partly, and partly by ſiege, and ſweat.</p>
               <p>For the oyl of <hi>Thereb:</hi> is of a laxative quality, not on the ſcore of a venemous reſolution of the parts, but as it makes the expulſive faculties mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their duties.</p>
               <p>And here note that the extreme bitterneſs of the <hi>Aloes,</hi> is changed into a pleaſant inoffenſive bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which by a more thorough preparation, and high advancement of the medicine, would be in a manner wholly extinct.</p>
               <p>To proceed then to the higheſt pitch of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, take of this Elixerated Samech, and by a ſecret Philoſophical proceſs, bring it firſt to a ſpontaneous Granulation, and ſo by degrees to a total Exſiccation, and feed it with Aromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Spirits, ſix, ſeven, or eight times, each time drieing it by the Air, and moiſtening it by the Fire, and Ferment of Nature, then by a modeſt fire of Sand, ſublime it, and thou ſhalt have both the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mech</hi> and the elixerated Oils and the glorified Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, together ſublimed, without the leaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrrheume which will retain the pleaſant fragran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the ſpecifick excellencies of the <hi>Concretes,</hi> and in its operation (in the <hi>doſe</hi> of ſome ten, fifteen, or twenty grains) will ſhew its true, and higheſt <hi>Craſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the elixerated <hi>Samech</hi> is a noble medicine, as I ſaid, and fragrant, and admirable in its effects againſt very many diſeaſes, and ſo needs not (unleſs for extraordinary occaſions) be brought to that paſs as actually to be ſublimed, it is ſufficient, that it is ſublimable, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51297:92"/>to produce ſtupendious effects, the other higheſt preparation being exceeding tedious, this other being not the work of a few daies, nor of very few Weeks, ſo that to doe it as it ought to be, will require a Patient, and diſcreet Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt.</p>
               <p>And this proceſs of the <hi>Elixir proprietatis</hi> take as a rule for preparing any tincture, whether of <hi>Hellebore</hi> black or white, with which uſe ſpirit aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with <hi>Cardamom,</hi> and <hi>Coriander Seeds;</hi> or <hi>Colocynthida,</hi> with which uſe what Aromatick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit beſt pleaſeth you, but for the commixture of <hi>Species,</hi> take my Compoſition; <hi>Hellebore</hi> is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſplenetical, and Cephalical, with it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Aſarum</hi> roots, and <hi>Zalap,</hi> ſometimes it and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium,</hi> which I call <hi>Elixir.

               <p>I had determined to have concluded this <hi>treatiſe</hi> in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> and ſo to have added a little, for a cloſe, of the manner of uſing and applying thoſe remedies, whoſe ground and manner of making, I have before ſufficiently diſcovered, but a <hi>Cordial</hi> and <hi>Intimate Friend,</hi> who had read and peruſed what I had written, while it was yet in my hands (having lent it to him for that end) he was pleaſed (upon the peruſal, to ſend me an ingenious and friendly letter, with ſeveral important <hi>Queries,</hi> to which he requeſted me (on the ſcore of our mutual friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) to give him ſatisfactory and publick anſwer, which I (judging it an equal requeſt, and ſo indeed in effect a command) thought I could not hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely deny or refuſe, and therefore what I inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have added to this, more briefly, becauſe it muſt there fall in more largely and fully, I thought good rather to omit it here, and to ſend the Reader thither for his further ſatisfaction.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur kind and very learned Letter, I received; peruſed, and in it am ſenſible of the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that lies upon me toward you, for your Cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al love in it expreſſed to me. How I have, or could deſerve it, I ſea not, and how to be able to requite it I am out of hopes: Yet gratefulneſs compells me to acknowledge, what inability de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies me to recompence, and waving Ceremony in acknowledging, I come, and that moſt willingly to anſwer thoſe <hi>Queries</hi> contained in your Letter. And pardon me, <hi>Sir,</hi> if I do not anſwer them in the ſame order as you ſent them me, but in ſuch Order as beſt befits the method of my <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> which muſt be a ſummary explication of the whole Art of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotechny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Queſtions</hi> then, <hi>Sir,</hi> (as I underſtand them) are ſome of them, ſuch in which you deſire to be informed, and ſome in which under the diſguiſe of a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> you inſinuate to me partly vvhat you judge to be for my good, and partly what you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive either really doth, or probably may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51297:93"/>or inconvenient to me, that I may doe the one, and avoid the other; in the latter you ſhew your ſelf to me a Cordiall friend, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an ingenious and diſcreet <hi>Zetetick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing you ſeem deſirous to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in, is whether I have of all thoſe preparations by me, of vvhich I vvrite, or have had of them, or (if otherwiſe) whether I write of them, onely upon Theoricall conjecture.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that every particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration I have not actually made, but the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Collaterall experiment of the ſame extent and Reaſon, is ſo abſolute a Confirmation of the other, that no demonſtration (unleſs actuall proof) can be plainer. As for inſtance, in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſpeak of the preparation of <hi>Zink,</hi> by mean of a volatile alcalizate ſalt, ſo that the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of it may come over tincted, &amp; dwell in the ſpirit, under one form or colour, <hi/> if I have, (as I have) actually try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this in ♁, and the ſtellate <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> I may conclude the other undeniably, the <hi>Zink</hi> yielding its <hi>Sulphur</hi> almoſt as eaſily as the ♁; farre more eaſily then the ſtellate <hi>Regulus.</hi> But then, where you replie, you ſhould not have adventured to deſcribe the colour of the oil to be of an high tincture; I anſwer, that I tryed ſo much of it, as to find in what colour it's <hi>Sulphur</hi> would come over, but I rather proſecuted my Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment (to the End) on the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of ♁, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature vomitive, in which the totall extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that <hi>Emetick</hi> quality was an Experiment, I was equally deſirous of, with the knowledge of any other Circumſtance, nor had I ſuch quantity of the ſpirit, nor ſuch variety of furnaces, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51297:94"/>of Room, as would permit me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my experiments ſo far as I would, in any mineral, nor ſo far in all as on ♄, (and one or two more) therefore I wrote of that ſubject more conciſely, reſerving a larger compleat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thereon (and upon the myſteries of the <hi>Microcoſme</hi>) till a more convenient ſeaſon, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe noble mettalline preparations for my next ſearch, when God ſhall be pleaſed to afford me a convenient ſettlement.</p>
            <p>As for my preſent being, of which you adviſe me to give a publique account, becauſe you ſay, <hi>That perſons of conſiderate judgements, who have read my</hi> Natures Explication, <hi>do cenſure that piece as too Satyrical and invective, and gueſsing it to be the Cauſe of my being maligned, and a little for a time oppreſt, from the ſuppoſed effect, they cenſure the Imaginary cauſe, as being too tart and bitter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt I muſt crave leave to tell you in the words of noble <hi>Helmont, That I am not the firſt, nor shall I be the laſt, that shall sharply inveigh againſt them,</hi> and I appeal to the world, if or no what I taxed, did not deſerve a ſevere and ſharp animadverſion, but beſides that, I may ſay, <hi>Iacta nunc eſt Alea,</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicon is caſt, and it is not now a thing which will admit of advice (whether I ſhould have been ſo tart or no) though ſince (to deal ingenuouſly) <hi>Cynthius Aurem vedit, Apollo</hi> hath pluckt me by the <hi>Ear,</hi> and whiſperd this counſel, <hi>Non exaſperandes crabones,</hi> they are a company of Waſps and Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which will not ſuffer a provocation, but they will buzze about and ſting, and yet they are but Waſps and Horners, and if I can be but ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to fire their neſt (which I hope I ſhall) it will not trouble me to be a little ſtung, ſince I ſhall
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51297:94"/>do the Commonwealth of learning a remarkable peece of ſervice, although my ſelf happen to ſmart a little.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Sir,</hi> you are ſufficiently convinced, that my preſent reſtraint is not upon that ſcore, for I am a Phyſician, graduated as well as any that practiſe in Town, and have as much Authority on my ſide for my Practiſe, and as much Reaſon, and much more Truth and Experience on my ſide, for what I plead, againſt the common Galenical method.</p>
            <p>But my confinement for a time happens through the malice of a remarkable adverſarie, conſidering whoſe crooked diſpoſition, ſuited to the like frame of Body, that which once was ſaid of <hi>Galba</hi> in a like caſe, <hi>Ingenium Calbae malè habitat</hi> (having an upright noble mind in an unlike body) may here be inverted, for if ever there were man whoſe mind and body did moſt exactly agree, he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is one, of whom I might have been aware, had I remembred the <hi>Adagie, Hos caveas ſemper, tu quos Natura notavit.</hi> But <hi>quondam</hi> familiarity with him gave opportunity to his future vexation of me, which he proſecuted with ſuch earneſtneſs, as if he had accounted it ſufficient gain to be prejudicial to my quiet: What moved him to it (ſave his own perverſe diſpoſition) a daies racking would ſcarce inforce me to gueſs, perhaps it might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of a future name, which if it were, I heartily wiſh that he may have his deſire, and if my writings be worth future eſteem, I am content that he live in them, and I doubt not but ſuch a name as <hi>Opori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> got by his maligning and perſecuting <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> ſuch he may get by his cauſeleſs vexation of me, which I ſhall contribute as much as I can, and I do

            <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> although I formerly have been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, yet at preſent, I am ſo much a ſtranger to him, that your news is to me news, which I hear with pitty, (namely,) that it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſince he hath given up himſelf to vex and diſturb me, he is Eclipſed in his reputation, (both as to his skill, as alſo to his morralls) being accounted a better Gameſter, then a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician; a better Carouſer, then a Chriſtian: for which relation, I owe you both a ſigh, and a tear; For really, (though he hath been to me a moſt perverſe, wretched adverſary, and that moſt cauſeleſſely,) yet I ſo much honour him, for the ſake of the Art he pretends to, <hi>(Viz,) Chemiſtry,</hi> that I could wiſh him, not only a pattern of Ingenie, but alſo of Pietie; For really <hi>Sir,</hi> I muſt give a true teſtimony of him; that he is a man of no contemptible parts, (and for his hatred to me, let the world eſteem what they pleaſe;) however, I ſhall doe him that right, that he wants neither wit, as a man, nor learning as a Scholler, nor diſcretion as a <hi>Theoricall</hi> diſſenter from the <hi>Galenical</hi> way: nor acuteneſſe, as a Chemicall preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51297:95"/>but if he want ſomething in nature to make him a compleat upright man, much more in grace to make him a true Chriſtian; (being of all the profeſt Chriſtians that ever I knew, the moſt Exemplarily ſwearing, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous) and cannot be excuſed in <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> for his defects therein, (on which ſcore onely I preſume he hates and malignes me;) pardon me <hi>Sir,</hi> if I endeavour to Conceal what I can, of his imperfections, and (as much as in me is,) make common and publick his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Sir,</hi> give me leave to adviſe you cordially, and indifferently; If any man have counſelled you to him, as to an able Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt and Phyſician; let me not be thought (on the ſcore of his unworthy dealing with me) to be diſſuaſive to you from him.</p>
            <p>For what concerns his Schollarſhip, you need not queſtion, and if you ſhould, I who know him very well, dare on my knowledge aſſure you, that he is (that way) moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; His actuall skill in Chemicall things, I will not, I cannot extoll; but what concerns his good will toward them, I am not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacquainted therewith, and although concerning ſome things I am informed that he pretends excellent skill; yet I muſt inform the ingenious Reader, that he is not, what he deſires to appear, the moſt acute of our <hi>English</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, but hath his dark intervalls, as well as the moſt illuminate Artiſts have had
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51297:96"/>theirs ſometimes, which is the worſt that I ſhall ſay of him, and will be heartily glad to hear, that <hi>William Currer</hi> is once at length Adopted, among the experimental Philoſophers, and to find him among the true Adept Pyrotechniſts, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genetated by the Fire, and ſo wiſhing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent his unworthie malicious tricks, whereby he diſturbed my quies cauſeleſsly, perverted my At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, produced an unconſcionable Hellfaced fellow (with a buſhel wide Conſcience) to ſwear againſt me, and prevaricate againſt the truth, by which Oath I was conſiderably and unrighteouſly damnified, wiſhing him (I ſay) cordial and true repentance, for all theſe tricks and praying hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that God would forgive him (as I from my heart have done and do) I come to anſwer the reſidue of your queſtions.</p>
            <p>You deſire a brief account of what I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as to medicinal <hi>Chemiſtry,</hi> which is a Natural <hi>Quere,</hi> following the former, and will ſatisfie the intelligent Reader on what ground, and for what Reaſons I have (on ſo unworthy a ſcore) embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a confinement for almoſt this twelve-months time, being in my power to have broken this Woodcocks yoaks and bonds at my pleaſure.</p>
            <p>For a thorough information of you herein, be pleaſed to underſtand (which I know you are not ignorant of) the Art of Chemiſtrie, doth by ſecret (and ſome tedious Operations, bring to light, the obſcure and hidden virtues which Nature hath put in many Simples, by which many diſeaſes (in themſelves very difficult and impoſſible to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Galenical</hi> art) are by Gods bleſſing very ſafely, eaſily, and certainly remedied.</p>
            <p>You ſee, <hi>Sir,</hi> that my ſearch and diſquiſition is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51297:96"/>not (as ſome were pleaſed falſely and fooliſhly to inſinuate to you) emploied about vain and trivial enquiries, but what may concerne the benefit of mankind (as to the Cure of thoſe diſeaſes, which moſt dangerouſly and ſpecedily threaten mans life, or pervert his health) hath been, is, and ſhall be the principal object of my Studie, and the main ſubject of my moſt ſerious Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sir,</hi> as I at large ſhewed in my forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, the diſeaſes to which man is ſubject, are various, and are by various medicaments to be remedied.</p>
            <p>The cure which is performed by means of <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> appropriated and ſpecificated to each diſeaſe, we affirmed poſſible, not diſtruſting that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine bounty hath provided a Remedie for all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in the vaſt Catalogue of <hi>Simples</hi> that he hath made, but why a Son of <hi>Art</hi> is incouraged to ſearch more ſecret waies for the finding out adequate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for diſeaſes, you may ſee the reaſon at large in the former book of <hi>Pyrotechny,</hi> my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration to vvit to thoſe who are ſtudiouſly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the ſearch of Nature, as alſo in my Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſober and diſcreet ſearcher after natures myſteries, who to wit, ſo ſeeks by the fire, as to attein what he ſeeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of medicaments (that deſerve to be ſo called and reputed, I ſhewed you that there were two ſorts, ſuch which cure <hi>(in Tono uniſono)</hi> and <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks,</hi> of the latter ſort, ſome are ſo truly and nearly ſuccedaneous to the <hi>grand Arcana</hi> that they doe in a manner aſpire unto their univerſal am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude and efficacie, others are more preciſely ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, yet nobly excellent and efficacious beyond
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51297:97"/>all the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> drugs. Many (and thoſe very truculent) diſcaſes, I ſhewed, doe not for their cure require the <hi>grand Arcana,</hi> nor yet the higheſt <hi>ſuccedanea's</hi> to them, but are curable by <hi>ſpecifick</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of an inferiour rank as <hi>fevers, fluxes, coughs,</hi> &amp;c</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Sir,</hi> of theſe <hi>ſpecifick remedies,</hi> Nature ſeems bountifull, even unto prodigality, (ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull is the God of nature to unworthy mankind,) which <hi>ſpecificks</hi> are uſually the firſt Crown and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a ſtudious and diligent Artiſts ſearch.</p>
            <p>And among <hi>ſpecificks,</hi> it is to be noted attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that thoſe which are of moſt excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (when made) are the moſt tedious, and and moſt ſecret in their preparation, yet ſo that one is as it were a guide, and a ſtep to the finding out of others.</p>
            <p>This premiſed, for the full ſatisfaction of your <hi>Query,</hi> give me leave to tell you, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of which I have written, but I have through the help and aſſiſtance of God prepared and made, yet am not alwayes furniſhed with all ſorts of theſe medicaments, nor with the moſt noble ſorts, for which I ſhall give you (ere I leave this ſubject) ſatisfactory reaſons. For as I told you before, in this ſearch; firſt leſſe noble, &amp; after that more commanding medicaments doe open themſelves to a ſtudious ſearcher, yet the leſſe noble are ſufficiently commanding as to acute diſeaſes, viz. <hi>fevers, fluxes, pluriſies,</hi>  the occaſionall matter of which lying, or adhering to the firſt veſſels, it is by <hi>abſterſive</hi> and <hi>reſolutive</hi> remedies diſſolved and removed; theſe ſorts of medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then are of largeſt uſe, although not of largeſt extent; for how many thouſands yearly are afflicted with acute truculent diſeaſes, which
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51297:97"/>hazard life, and actually deſtroy many both in City and country.</p>
            <p>For which diſeaſes although many remedies may be, and are made, yet thoſe are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, which may be made in largeſt quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and which being made, may be applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to moſt griefs.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that although I know many <hi>ſpecifiek remedies</hi> for <hi>feavers,</hi> which I have oft made, and uſed, yet when I find a medicine of no more difficulty of preparation; and far larger ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in vertue when prepared, I wave the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of others, and content my ſelf with that one as far forth as that one will perform, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the <hi>Adagy, fruſtra fit per plura quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having once known the preparation of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble medicine, my chief ſtudy is by daily reiterated experiments, what I can to mend the preparation, by which it may be made either with leſs tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; difficulty; or, when made, may be more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to take, or more efficacious in in its operation.</p>
            <p>True, I make daily many experiments of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of medicaments to a higher &amp; nobler ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but I chiefly practiſe ſuch which I can moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently make in largeſt quantities. For I account it more honourable in a <hi>Phyſician</hi> to be able to cure thouſands of acute diſeaſes yearly, then to intend wholly the preparation of the more noble medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which although they will cure inferiour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, yet they need not be there uſed, where a more eaſie preparation will perform the Cure, nor can a man be ſufficiently ſtored with them for all the objects of pity and charity which annually preſent themſelves.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:51297:98"/>
            <p>I grant that if a man were fitted with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, to follovv both ſort of preparations, it were not amiſſe for a man to ſtore himſelf with medicaments of all degrees, but my misfortune hath been that I have ſtill wanted Convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, being ſtill ſo ſtraightned for conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencie, that I could onely attend few experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at a time, and thoſe have uſually been intended for the preparing ſuch remedies which were of moſt generall, though not of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe, and ever by the by, I have ſtill been proſecuting farther and higher diſcoveries, of which I have in my foregoing Treatiſes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſeverall; which uſually I doe but in ſmall quantities, becauſe tedious operations are ever accompanied with hazard, nor is it eaſie for one who hath done a thing in ſmall quantities, ſtraight way to make it in larger proportions, for aſmuch as the fire is an <hi>heteroclit agent,</hi> nor is it ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>geometricall</hi> rules of <hi>proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Sir</hi> this hath been the true ground of my patient acceptance of ten months confinement, that I might <hi>(vacare experimentis)</hi> which was ſcarce permitted to me while at liberty, for he that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a medicinall practiſe, will find his time ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with multiplicity of active and paſſive vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, that it is not poſſible for him to attend ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and tedious ſearches, and to commit the management of ſuch things to a Careleſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is ſo uncertain a Courſe to prove ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that it will ſoon make an Artiſt weary who ſhall take that way. In this time then I have had opportunity of trying very many things, and have made it my buſineſſe to reduce thoſe <hi>Theori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Contemplations,</hi> and <hi>Concluſions,</hi> (which read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51297:98"/>and collaterall Experiments had ſuggeſted unto me) unto <hi>practiſe,</hi> but to prepare any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of the more difficultly preparable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, is a work vvhich I adjourn to a fitter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, which I hope God will ſhortly give me, or elſe I ſhall retire into ſome other place, to find that opportunity which is heere deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me.</p>
            <p>And thus I come in order to that query of yours, namely what I would adviſe one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give up himſelf to a ſearch of Natures myſteries, and is not maſter of the more noble preparations.</p>
            <p>My adviſe and Counſell to ſuch a one is that which I take my ſelf, not having conveniencie to prepare ſuch medicaments, which I rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, for I account it one and the ſame thing (as to effect) to vvant the nobler remedies, either for lack of knowledge of preparing them, or for want of conveniencie to prepare them in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent quantities.</p>
            <p>My Counſell I ſay in ſuch a caſe is the ſame with the noble <hi>Helmonts, Si ſordes primis haeſerint la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebris, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>endum abſterſivis, &amp; reſolutivis, natura tuto ſatagente reliquum.</hi> There are many of theſe abſterſive remedies, which will not fail a Conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Phyſitian. Of this ſort are <hi>alcalyes alcoodited,</hi> as with ſpirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> or of <hi>vitriol,</hi> &amp;c. or <hi>Elixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> with <hi>oyles,</hi> or a <hi>vinous ſpirit,</hi> which may be ſpecificated with any <hi>vegetable,</hi> as the Artiſt ſhall pleaſe; and theſe operations are not ſo tedious, nor ſo difficult, but that quantity may be made of remedies, for the cure of many thouſands, and that yearly.</p>
            <p>But then he addes, <hi>ſi penitiori receſſu haeſerius,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51297:99"/>aſsumenda ſunt alcalia volatilia, quae inſtar ſaponis cuncta abſtergunt,</hi> &amp;c. then in ſuch caſes volatize your <hi>alcalyes,</hi> and ſpecificate them with minerall <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> and you ſhall attain your deſire.</p>
            <p>But in a mans practiſe ſcarce the fortieth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe will abſolutely require thoſe highly gradua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted remedies, and therefore powerfull and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall abſterſives may fulfill a ſtudious and Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Phyſicians</hi> deſires.</p>
            <p>Now beſides the <hi>abſterſive quality</hi> of ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there are they, which have a parative diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and as it were by a Charm allay the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the inraged <hi>Archeus,</hi> bringing it to reſt and quiet, and ſo blotting out the angry <hi>Idea</hi> impreſt on it: of which ſort in the minerall family I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the <hi>Ens</hi> of ♀ prepared according to <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts</hi> direction, in his Tractate intituled <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> which is made by the <hi>volatile</hi> ſalt of <hi>urine</hi> vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from it<hi>'s foetor,</hi> with which the dulcified <hi>Colcothar</hi> of <hi>vitriol</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> is ſublimed twice or thrice, and both become a glorious <hi>tincted Body,</hi> or rather <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the doſe of 5. or 6. <hi>gr.</hi> curing <hi>Fevers, Agues, Pluriſyes,</hi> &amp;c: and giving eaſe in all <hi>exorbitancyes</hi> of the inraged <hi>Archeus,</hi> nor is the operation of it ſo tedious, but that it may be made in quantitie, and in no long time.</p>
            <p>In the vegetable familie the true preparation of <hi>Opium</hi> is an excellent remedy, which if prepared with the volatile <hi>Elixerated alcali</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> (eſpecially by it's <hi>Samech</hi>) is eminently <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uretick</hi> and <hi>Diaphoretick,</hi> and aſſwages all pain in the Bodie, and is an approued remedie for more then fourtie ſeverall diſeaſes, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of other <hi>ſimples,</hi> it is made more and more noble, in it's operation, eſpecially by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
